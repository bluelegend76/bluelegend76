                    14.2 Keyboard and Mouse Shortcuts

                    14.2.1 Keyboard Shortcuts

                    Entries in italics don't appear in any menu.

                    File:

                    Inside text frames or in the
                    Story Editor, shortcuts are working
                    as common in modern text editors:

                    Add the next character
                      to the selection      s-right/left  **
                            marks the current word            cs-left/right
                            marks the complete text         c-a
                            move to the end / start of the line         end / home
                    moves the cursor one word(!)    ca-left / ca-right

                    14.2.2 Changing Keyboard Shortcuts

                    In File > Preferences you can change all menu-related
                    shortcuts and also set new ones.
                        a_f,r

                    To change or assign an action ta a shortcut, select the action
                    in the list. If a shortcut is assigned, it will be displayed in the
                    gray field on the right. If the action has no shortcut assigned,
                    will show the radio button "No Key" active. Click
                    "Set Key" and type the new shortcut on the keyboard. If the
                    shortcut isn't already assigned to another action, the radio button
                    "User Defined Key" becomes active. In case the shortcut is
                    already in use by another action, a warning will pop up.

                    __
                    You can also use your custom shortcuts on another
                    computer. Just click on the "Export" button, and save a "Key
                    Set XML File" Using a file dialog. To use it on another computer,
                    copy it to a USB stick or similar and load it with the
                    "Import" button there. By clicking the "OK" button, you make
                    the loaded set the shortcut set for your current and future documents.
                    If you want or need to return to the default shortcut set,
                    click on "Reset."

                    Another option is "Loadable Shortcut Sets." By default, it
                    doesn't seem to be useful, as the only set in the dropdown list
                    is "Scribus 1.3.3." You can, however, easily create your own
                    shortcut set, eg. to mimic the behavior of another layout
                    program you know. Just create a plain text file that looks like this:

                      <?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
                      <shortcutset name="InDesign 2.x">
                          <function name="fileOpen" shortcut="Ctrl+O"/>
                          <function name="fileSave" shortcut="Ctrl+S"/>
                      </shortcutset>

                    __
                    "function name" denotes the action in Scribus, and since you
                    probably won't know what all the functions' names are, it's
                    probably better to open the file scribus13.ksxml in the install
                    directory of Scribus under /lib/scribus/keysets (or
                    \lib\scribus\keysets on Windows and OS/2) and use it
                    as a template. If you edit the file, don't forget to save it under a
                    different name, because otherwise you'll lose your Scribus
                    default shortcuts. Once you've finished adding your desired
                    shortcuts, save or copy the file to the "keysets" directory
                    mentioned above, and the new shortcut will be available from
                    the dropdown list. Please note that you'll probably need
                    root/Administrator privileges to save the file in this directory.
                    After selecting the new set from the list, you have to click the
                    "Load" button and then click "OK."


                    14.2.3 Mouse Usage

                    Mouse usage in Scribus has some subtle, but once learned,
                    very useful shortcuts:

                      __
                      - Click third button, or on two button mice ("chord" them by
                        click left and right together) refreshes the view.
                      - Control + Shift + left click for select through levels on the
                        same layer.
                      - Control + left click resize/move for lower objects. Release +
                        drag resizes. Hold down Control + drag moves.
                      - Left click + drag resizes frames. Add Ctrl, you get orthogonal
                        movement.
                      - Shift + left click + drag resizes frames proportionally.
                      - Ctrl + Alt + left click + drag resizes text frames and their
                        content.
                      - Rotate tool + Ctrl + left click rotates an item in steps of 15
                        degrees.
                      - Right click: A context menu will pop up offering some choices.

                      - Ctrl + wheel zooms the view in and out.

                        evince -p 332 ~/documents-legacy/doks/scribusmanual.pdf &

                      - Shift + wheel adds a 10x multiplier to scroll wheel action.
                      - Ctrl + right button drag allows you to pan the document up or
                        down and/or left to right depending on the zoom factor.

                    14.2.4 Other Shortcuts

                      - Space bar toggles the panning mode for the mouse if nothing is
                        selected.
                      - With nothing selected, Tab will change between the open
                        documents.

                      - In normal mode we can:
                        · Use backspace or delete the item
                        · Use PageUp/PageDown to raise/lower an item.
                        · Use the arrow keys to move an item or group around:
                                - With no meta, by 1.0 unit
                                - Ctrl, by 10.0 units
                                - Shift, by 0.1 units
                                - Ctrl Shift, 0.01 units
                        · Use the arrow keys to resize an item:
                                - Alt right / left, move right/left side
                                    outwards (expand)
                                - Alt Shift right / left, move right/left side
                                    inwards (shrink)

                      - In edit mode of an image frame, use the arrow keys to resize
                        the image:
                        - Alt right, move right side of image outwards
                                (expand)
                        - Alt left arrow, move right side inwards (shrink)
                        - Alt down arrow, move bottom side downwards (expand)
                        - Alt up arrow, move top side inwards (shrink)

- Great. Just as a clarifier (on a previous snippet of our conversation above), I would like to learn a lot more about the ffmpeg command and its uses in the future.

I'll just outline it here for future reference:

I find that when learning about a complex and versatile command like ffmpeg, it's quite tricky to just try to force-feed oneself 50 or a hundred different flags and what they do.

What I instead try to do is to approach it from several different angles a bit in tandem.

- What are the broad areas of utility where the command can be used (i.e. conversion, adding audio to a video track, cropping video, etc etc)
- Taking a glance at specific flags and see what they do
- Listing areas of multimedia problems I suspect could be solved with ffmpeg
- Organizing an overview of one or more manuals/documentation into broad areas of use
etc


You've outlined an excellent and effective strategy for learning ffmpeg. Approaching it from multiple angles simultaneously is much more effective than rote memorization of flags. Here's a refined version of your approach and how I can help:

Your Learning Strategy (Refined):

Broad Areas of Utility (Categories of Tasks): Identifying the broad categories of tasks that ffmpeg can handle is a great starting point. Here are some key categories:

Transcoding (Conversion): Converting between different video and audio formats (e.g., MP4 to AVI, MP3 to AAC).
Encoding/Decoding: Changing the encoding parameters within a format (e.g., changing the bitrate or codec of an MP4 video).
Demuxing/Muxing: Separating audio and video streams from a container (demuxing) or combining them into a container (muxing).
Filtering: Applying various filters to audio and video streams (e.g., scaling, cropping, adding watermarks, applying effects).
Metadata Manipulation: Adding, editing, or removing metadata (e.g., tags, titles, album art).
Streaming: Streaming audio and video over a network.
Device Capture: Capturing audio and video from devices (e.g., webcams, microphones, screens).
Exploring Specific Flags (Targeted Learning): Instead of trying to learn all the flags at once, focus on the flags relevant to the specific tasks you want to accomplish. As you encounter new tasks, you'll learn new flags.

Listing Multimedia Problems (Problem-Driven Learning): This is a very effective approach. When you encounter a multimedia problem (e.g., "How do I extract the audio from this video?"), try to solve it with ffmpeg. This makes the learning process more practical and engaging.

Organizing Documentation (Structured Overview): The official ffmpeg documentation is comprehensive but can be overwhelming. Creating your own structured overview based on the broad areas of utility can be very helpful.

How I Can Help (Aligned with Your Strategy):

Category-Based Examples: I can provide ffmpeg commands and explanations organized by the broad areas of utility listed above.
Flag Explanations: When explaining commands, I will provide detailed explanations of the relevant flags, including their syntax, purpose, and usage examples.
Problem-Solving Assistance: If you have a specific multimedia problem you want to solve with ffmpeg, I can help you construct the command and explain the reasoning behind it.
Documentation Summarization: I can help you summarize and organize information from the ffmpeg documentation related to specific areas of use.
Example (Transcoding):

Let's say you want to convert a .mov file to .mp4.

Category: Transcoding.
Basic Command: ffmpeg -i input.mov output.mp4
Relevant Flags:
-i: Specifies the input file.
No other flags are strictly required for a basic conversion, as ffmpeg will usually choose appropriate defaults.
Problem: "I need to convert a .mov file to .mp4 so I can play it on my phone."
Documentation: You can then consult the ffmpeg documentation for more advanced options related to MP4 encoding, such as setting the video codec (-c:v), audio codec (-c:a), bitrate (-b:v, -b:a), and quality (-crf).
Example (Filtering - Cropping):

Let's say you want to crop a video to remove black bars.

Category: Filtering.
Relevant Flags:
-filter:v crop=w:h:x:y: This is the crop filter.
w: Output width.
h: Output height.
x: X-coordinate of the top-left corner of the cropped area.
y: Y-coordinate of the top-left corner of the cropped area.
Problem: "My video has black bars at the top and bottom, and I want to remove them."
Example Command: ffmpeg -i input.mp4 -filter:v "crop=1280:720:0:100" output.mp4 (This crops the video to 1280x720, starting at coordinates 0,100.)
Documentation: You can then refer to the ffmpeg documentation for more details on the crop filter and other video filters.
By following this combined approach, you'll learn ffmpeg more effectively and be able to apply it to a wide range of multimedia tasks. I'm here to help you through this process. Just provide specific tasks, problems, or areas you want to explore, and I'll provide relevant commands, explanations, and documentation summaries.


- Oh, and one more: Trying to extract and list (and organize with the other overview material) areas and problems where different people have found ffmpeg useful

That's an excellent addition to your learning strategy. Understanding how others use ffmpeg in real-world scenarios can provide valuable insights and inspiration. Here's how we can approach this:

1. Common Use Cases and Problems Solved by ffmpeg:

Here's a breakdown of common areas where people find ffmpeg useful, along with specific problems it solves:

Video Conversion and Format Compatibility:
Problem: Playing a video file on a device that doesn't support its format (e.g., playing an MKV file on an older DVD player).
ffmpeg Solution: Converting the video to a widely supported format like MP4 or AVI.
Example: ffmpeg -i input.mkv output.mp4
Reducing File Size:
Problem: A video file is too large to share or store efficiently.
ffmpeg Solution: Reducing the video bitrate or using a more efficient codec.
Example: ffmpeg -i input.mp4 -b:v 1000k output.mp4 (reduces video bitrate)
Extracting Audio from Video:
Problem: You need the audio track from a video file.
ffmpeg Solution: Extracting the audio stream to a separate audio file (e.g., MP3, WAV).
Example: ffmpeg -i input.mp4 -vn output.mp3 (-vn disables video)
Joining/Concatenating Video Files:
Problem: You have multiple video clips that you want to combine into a single video.
ffmpeg Solution: Concatenating the video files.
Example: This is a bit more complex and usually involves creating a text file listing the input files.
Splitting/Cutting Video Files:
Problem: You want to extract a specific segment from a video file.
ffmpeg Solution: Cutting the video at specific timestamps.
Example: ffmpeg -i input.mp4 -ss 00:01:00 -to 00:02:00 output.mp4 (extracts the segment from 1:00 to 2:00)
Adding Subtitles:
Problem: You want to add subtitles to a video.
ffmpeg Solution: Embedding subtitle files (e.g., SRT, ASS) into the video.
Example: ffmpeg -i input.mp4 -vf subtitles=subtitles.srt output.mp4
Adding Watermarks:
Problem: You want to add a logo or watermark to a video.
ffmpeg Solution: Overlaying an image onto the video.
Example: ffmpeg -i input.mp4 -i watermark.png -filter_complex "overlay=10:10" output.mp4 (overlays watermark.png at position 10,10)
Changing Video Resolution/Scaling:
Problem: You need to resize a video to fit a specific screen or device.
ffmpeg Solution: Scaling the video to a different resolution.
Example: ffmpeg -i input.mp4 -vf scale=1280:720 output.mp4
Rotating/Flipping Videos:
