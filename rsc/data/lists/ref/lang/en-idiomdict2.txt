INTRODUCTION
If I may be accused o f encouraging or inventing a new vice - the mania,
or ‘idiomania, I may perhaps call it - o f collecting what Pater calls the
‘gypsy phrases’ o f our language, I have at least been punished by becom­
ing one o f its most careless and incorrigible victims. (Logan Pearsall
Smith, Words and Idioms, 1925)
Our belief is that people turn to a book on idioms for two main purposes:
for reference and to browse. We have tried to cater for both.
Reference
Each phrase dealt with in the body of the book is listed alphabetically in
relation to a key word in it. As idioms are by definition phrases and not
single words, there is necessarily a choice to be made of which word to
classify the phrase by. We have exercised our judgement as to which is the
key word (normally a noun or a verb) but, in case our intuitions do not
coincide with the reader’s, we have provided an index of the important words
in each expression.
The head words are followed by a definition. This is the contemporary
sense or senses - an important point, given that many idioms have a long
history and have undergone changes in meaning, often marked ones, during
the centuries. Similarly, the comments under Usage are there to provide
guidance on the current formality or informality of the phrase, typical con­
texts of its use, its grammatical peculiarities, variations in form - all necessary
reference material given that idioms characteristically break the rules (see
What is an idiom?, page 6).
A further guide to usage lies in the contemporary quotations that are a
part of many entries. Quotations are listed in chronological order and the
more recent provide a taste of how modern authors use idioms. We would

like to thank Harper Collins for permission to use a number of quotations
from their computer corpus (acknowledged in the text in each instance as
‘Cobuild Corpus’). We have drawn on the traditional collections of extracts
for other examples, but the great majority of the contemporary illustrations
are from the serendipity of our eclectic reading over the last year. We make
no claims for comprehensive coverage of today’s press - the quoting of Good
Housekeeping and the Mid Sussex Times simply means that we read them
regularly!
The bibliography is there both to show our sources and to provide a point
of extended reference. It is by no means complete: it contains some of the
books we have referred to which are collections of idioms of one type or
another. To have included them all - not to mention the hundreds of books
of general language and wider reference we have consulted - would have
produced a bibliography of unmanageable length. If in the text of the book
we refer to a specific source, the name of the author alone may be given
(e.g. Edwards); if he has more than one entry in the bibliography, the name
is followed by a date (e.g. Funk 1950).
Browsing
Our own love of the curious in language is, we have observed, shared by
others. For them, and for ourselves, we have written the parts of this book
that aim to please the browser.
The entries have been selected because they have a tale to tell. Many
idioms were rejected because there was nothing interesting to say about
them. Plenty more have had to be excluded because of pressures of time and
space, but we hope that what remains is a satisfying cross-section of the vast
range of idioms which occur in everyday English, even if it cannot claim to
be a comprehensive list.
The etymology - or etymologies, since there are often alternative accounts
- tries to go back to the earliest origins. We endeavour to give dates, but it
is often impossible to do this with any confidence. Phrases have literal mean­
ings, then they generally develop metaphorical uses and ultimately, in typical
cases, acquire an idiomatic sense that is separate from the literal one. The
form a phrase takes may also vary considerably over the years. It is therefore
extremely difficult to state accurately when the idiom was first used - as an
idiom. Wherever possible, we make the best estimate we can. We have also
sometimes selected quotations to show the historical change in the use or
form of phrases, as well as for their intrinsic interest.
The stories behind the expressions are in part those that authorities sug­
gest. Our own researches have added to or replaced these, where we felt it
was necessary. Quite often it is impossible to say with certainty what is the

best source; in these instances, we have not hesitated to admit that doubt
exists.
There are various essays strategically situated throughout the book (usually
near entries on a connected theme). These are of various kinds - linguistic,
historical, just plain curious - and are intended to inform and entertain. One
of them is entitled The Old Curiosity Shop of Linguistics (see page 108). This
could also serve as the watchword for all that we have tried to provide for
the browser!
In conclusion, our aim has been to provide a balance of reference information
and a richer varied diet for the curious; we have striven for scholarly accuracy
without falling into academic pedantry. We have certainly made mistakes
and would welcome comments and corrections.
We owe a debt to many. The erudition of Stevenson and Funk, for
example, is extraordinary and it is complemented in recent times by the
labours of Brandreth, Manser and Rees, amongst others. Our local library
has been very helpful and our children, John and Anna, extremely indulgent
with their occupied parents. To these and many more, our thanks.

Achilles’ heel, an______________
a weak or vulnerable spot in something
or someone which is otherwise strong

figurative use is only a hundred years old.
If something survives the acid test it has
been proved true beyond the shadow of
a doubt.

According to Greek mythology, Thetis
held her young son Achilles by the heel
while dipping him into the river Styx to
make him invulnerable. Achilles’ heel,
however, remained dry and was his only
weakness. After years as a brave and
invincible warrior, Achilles was killed
during the Trojan war by an arrow which
pierced his heel. His deadly enemy Paris
had learned of his secret and aimed at
the weak spot. The full story is told in
H omer’s Iliad.

usage: Bordering on a cliche

A social climber can ill afford an Achilles
heel, and this particular weakness on Hut­
chins' part would probably be disastrous
to him sooner or later.

Adam's ale is water, this being all that
Adam had to drink in Eden. The phrase

In an insolent proclamation from Lau­
sanne General Rapp added insult to injury
by telling the heirs o f a thousand years o f
ordered liberty that their history showed

the intervention o f France.
SIR A R T H U R B R Y A N T , Years o f Victory, 1944.

alive and kicking
very active, lively

Some authorities claim a very ancient
origin for this phrase, tracing it back to a
book of fables by the Roman writer
Phaedrus from about 25 BC. The fable in
question is The Bald Man and the Fly in
which a man attempts to squash an insect
which has just stung him on his bald patch
by delivering a smart smack. The fly
escapes the blow and mocks him for want­
ing to avenge the bite of a tiny insect with
death. To the injury of the sting he has
only succeeded in adding the insult of the
self-inflicted blow.
Other authorities, however, point out
that in past centuries, while ‘injury’ cer­
tainly meant physical hurt, it could also
equally well apply to wounded feelings
and was synonymous with ‘insult’. French
injure (from the same Latin origin iniuria)
has today the predominant sense of
‘insult, abuse’. The effect is therefore to
intensify the original injury by adding
‘insult to insult’.

This is one of those expressions that lend
themselves to imaginative interpretation.
Partridge (1940) suggests that it is a fishvendor’s call to advertise his wares. The
fish are so fresh that they are still jumping
and flapping about. Another authority
says it refers to the months of a pregnancy
following ‘quickening’, when the mother
is able to feel the child she is carrying
moving in her womb.
The universe isn't a machine after all. It's
alive and kicking. A nd in spite o f the fact
that man with his cleverness has dis­
covered some o f the habits o f our old
earth, the old demon isn't quite nabbed.
D. H. L A W R E N C E , Selected Essays, “Climbing D own
Pisgah', 1924.

I suppose if I died you'd cry a bit. That
would be nice o f you and very proper. But
I'm all alive and kicking. D on't you find
me rather a nuisance?

1930.

A nd now insult was added to injury. The

amuck

amuck: to run amuck__________
to be frenzied, out of control
The phrase comes from a Malayan word
amoq which describes the behaviour of
tribesmen who, perhaps under the influ­
ence of opium, would work themselves
into a murderous frenzy and lash out at
anyone they came across.
On its first introduction in the seven­
teenth century, there were varying spell­
ings. Then amuck became the accepted
form until well-travelled writers of this
century popularised the spelling amok.
They were accused of affectedly show­
ing off their knowledge of the source
language. Nowadays either spelling is
acceptable.
So that when the policeman arrived and
found me running amuck with an assegai
apparently without provocation, it was
rather difficult to convince him that I
wasn't tight.
P. G. W O D E H O U SE , Uncle Fred in the Springtime,
1939.

see also: to go berserk

angel: to write like an angel
to have beautiful handwriting; to be a
gifted writer of prose or poetry
Isaac D ’lsraeli gives the origin of the
expression in Curiosities o f Literature:

celestial accomplishments. This fanciful
phrase, however, has a very human
origin. Among those learned Greeks who
emigrated to Italy, and some afterwards
into France, in the reign of Francis I, was
one Angelo Vergecto, whose beautiful
calligraphy excited the admiration of the
learned. The French monarch had a
Greek fount cast, modelled by his writ­
ing. The learned Henry Stephens, who
was one of the most elegant writers of
Greek, had learnt the practice from
Angelo. His name became synonymous
for beautiful writing, and gave birth to
the phrase to write like an angel.
From this explanation it is evident that
the phrase is descriptive not of a person’s
style of writing, but of his handwriting.
This critic, therefore, shows a modern
shift of meaning for the idiom:
Tell-tale cliches ‘She writes like an angel’ (it
is usually a ‘she’; William Trevor is an
exception): this means almost nothing,
except that the critic doesn’t really know
what else to say; I ’ve probably done it
myself. Used about: Anita Brookner,

The phrase is from a speech given by Ben­
jamin Disraeli at Oxford in 1864.
Addressing the vexed issue of evolution,
Disraeli declared himself opposed to the
theory that our early ancestors were apes
and maintained that man was descended
from God: ‘Is man an ape or an angel? I,
my lord, am on the side of the angels.’
He had an idea that by bawling and behav­
ing offensively he was defending art
against the Philistines. Tipsy, he felt him ­

Originally, because of its shape, the apple
was a metaphor for the pupil of the eye.
As one’s eyesight is precious, so is the
person described as the apple o f one's eye.
The phrase as we use it today is a literal
translation of a Hebrew expression that
occurs five times in the Old Testament.
The earliest reference is in Deuteronomy
32:10, before 1000 BC. Through the
immense influence of the 1611 Author­
ised Version of the Bible it has become
common in the English of recent cen­
turies. Incidentally, there is some doubt
that the original Hebrew word (tappuah)
actually means apple - perhaps we should
be referring to the apricot, Chinese citron
or quince of one’s eye!

What is an idiom?
Language follows rules. If it did not, then its users would not be able to
make sense of the random utterances they read or heard and they would
not be able to communicate meaningfully themselves. Grammar books
are in effect an account of the regularities of the language, with notes on
the minority of cases where there are exceptions to the regular patterns.
Nearly all verbs, for example, add an s in the third person singular, present
tense (he walks, she throws, it appeals). There are obvious exceptions to
this basic ‘rule’ (he can, she may, it ought).
One of the interesting things about idioms is that they are anomalies of
language, mavericks of the linguistic world. The very word idiom comes
from the Greek idios, ‘one’s own, peculiar, strange’. Idioms therefore
break the normal rules. They do this in two main areas - semantically,
with regard to their meaning, and syntactically, with regard to their gram­
mar. A consideration, then, of the semantic and syntactic elements of
idioms leads to an answer to the question What is an idiom?
Meaning
The problem with idioms is that the words in them do not mean what they
ought to mean - an idiom cannot be understood literally. A bucket is ‘a
pail’ and to k ic k means ‘to move with the foot’. Yet to kick the bucket
probably does not mean ‘to move a pail with one’s foot’, it is likely to be
understood as ‘to die’. The meaning of the whole, then, is not the sum of
the meaning of the parts, but is something apparently quite unconnected
to them. To put this another way, idioms are mostly phrases that can have
a literal meaning in one context but a totally different sense in another.
If someone said Alfred spilled the beans all over the table, there would be
a nasty mess for him to clear up. If it were Alfred spilled the beans all
over the town, he would be divulging secrets to all who would listen.
An idiom breaks the normal rules, then, in that it does not mean what
you would expect it to mean. In fact the idiom is a new linguistic entity
with a sense attached to it that may be quite remote from the senses of
the individual words that form it. Although it is in form a phrase, it has
many of the characteristics of a single word.
Grammar
The second major way in which idioms are peculiar is with regard to their
grammar. There is no idiom that does not have some syntactic defect,
that fails to undergo some grammatical operation that its syntactic


    evince -p 14 /media/bluelegend/Verbatim/Empire/Doks/Lang/en-idiomdict2.pdf &

7

structure would suggest is appropriate.
Different types of idioms suffer from different restrictions. With a hot
dog, the following are not possible: the dog is hot, the heat o f the dog,
today's dog is hotter than yesterday's, it’s a very hot dog today. Yet with
the superficially identical phrase a hot sun there is no problem: the sun is
hot, the heat o f the sun, today's sun is hotter than yesterday’s, it's a very
hot sun today. Idioms that include verbs are similarly inflexible in the
manipulations that they will permit. For instance, why is it that you can’t
take the separate parts of to beat about the bush and substitute for them
a near synonym? There’s no way you can say hit about the bush, or beat
about the shrub. Nor can you change the definite article to the indefinite
- you can’t beat about a bush. It’s not possible to make bush plural. Who
ever heard of beating about the bushes'? The bush was beaten about is as
strange as the passive in the music was faced. Some idioms go further,
exhibiting a completely idiosyncratic grammatical structure, such as
intransitive verbs apparently with a direct object: to come a cropper, to
go the whole hog, to look daggers at.
The best examples of idioms, therefore, are very fixed grammatically and
it is impossible to guess their meaning from the sense of the words that
constitute them. Not all phrases meet these stringent criteria. Quite often
it is possible to see the link between the literal sense of the words and the
idiomatic meaning. It is because a route by which many phrases become
idioms involves a metaphorical stage, where the original reference is still
discernible. To skate on thin ice, ‘to court danger’, is a very obvious figure
of speech. The borderline between metaphor and idiom is a fuzzy one.
Other idioms allow a wide range of grammatical transformations: my
father read the riot act to me when I arrived can become I was read the
riot act by my father when I arrived or the riot act was read to me by my
father when I arrived. Much more acceptable than the bush was beaten
about!
In short, it is not that a phrase is or is not an idiom; rather, a given
expression is more or less ‘idiomaticky’, on an cline stretching from the
normal, literal use of language via degrees of metaphor and grammatical
flexibility to the pure idiom. To take an analogy, in the colour spectrum
there is general agreement on what is green and what is yellow but it is
impossible to say precisely where one becomes the other. So it is hard to
specify where the flexible metaphor becomes the syntactically frozen
idiom, with a new meaning all its own.

apple pie order, in_____________
with everything neatly arranged, in its
proper place
Where there is uncertainty, the sugges­
tions proliferate. For this phrase there is
a veritable smorgasbord of international
choice: French, Greek and American
origins are the main theories.
Two folk corruptions are suggested
from the French. The idea of the Old
French cap a pie, meaning ‘clothed in
armour from head to foot’, is that of an
immaculately ordered and fully equipped
soldier. Other researchers, Brewer
included, suggest the idiom may come
from the phrase nappe pliee (folded
linen), which conveys the idea of neatness
and tidiness.
In the nineteenth century, a learned
discussion in Notes and Queries con­
cluded that in apple-pie order was a cor­
ruption of in alpha, beta order, i.e. as
well-ordered as the letters of the (Greek)
alphabet.
Our Transatlantic cousins have also
tried to lay claim to the phrase by tracing
its origins to New England, where it is
said that housewives made pies of unbe­
lievable neatness, taking much time and
trouble to cut the apples into even slices
before arranging them just so, layer upon
perfect layer, in the crust.
The New England story may be true,

The phrase may be a folk corruption from

Alternatively, the expression may well
refer to an apple turnover, which is a
folded piece of pastry ( just as the sheet
is folded over in the bed), with an apple
filling in the middle.

Auspices is made up of two Latin words:
avis, ‘a bird’, and specere, ‘to observe’. In
ancient Rome it was customary to consult
an augur or soothsayer before making
weighty decisions. Affairs of state and
military campaigns were thus decided.
The augur would interpret natural
phenomena (known in the trade as aus­
pices) such as bird flight and bird song,
and examine the entrails of victims
offered for sacrifice, to make his predic­
tions. In war, only the commander in
chief would have access to this military
intelligence from his advisers, so any vic­
tory won by an officer of lower rank was
gained ‘under the good auspices’ of his
commander.
The expressions augur well and augur
ill have the same origin.
The French dispute therefore boils down
to a straight decision between our right to

French right to set their own teaching stan­

Rees attests that during the American
Civil War any soldier who absented him­
self without permission was forced to
wear a placard bearing the inscription
AWOL. During the First World War it
was used to describe a soldier who was
not present for rollcall but was not yet
classified as a deserter. At this time, the
four letters were pronounced individually
but, sometime before the Second World
War, the pronunciation ‘aywol’ became
current.

absent husbands, missing office workers,
etc.

axe: to have an axe to grind
to have a selfish, usually secret, motive
for doing something; to insist upon one’s
own fixed belief or course of action
All the authorities are agreed that the
phrase originates in a moral tale of a boy
who is flattered by a stranger into sharp­
ening his axe for him. The problem comes
in deciding which story and which author.
The OED and most other etymologists
ascribe the phrase to American diplomat
Benjamin Franklin, in an article entitled
‘Too Much for your Whistle’ - his early
career was that of a journalist. The story
concerns a young man who wants his
whole axe as shiny as the cutting edge.
The smith agrees to do it - provided that
the man turns the grindstone himself. Of
course, he soon tires and gives up, realis­
ing he has bitten off more than he can
chew.
A similar story, W ho’ll turn the grind­
stone?, is popularly associated with

Franklin. However, it was published
some twenty years after his death and was
in fact written by Charles Miner. There is
doubt as to its place of publication: some
say in the Luzerne Federalist of 7/9/1810,
others in the Wilkesbarre Gleaner of
Pennsylvania in 1811.
The story itself clearly draws on
Franklin’s tale. It is about Poor Robert,
who is talked into turning the grindstone
for a man wanting to sharpen his axe. The
story continues:
Tickled with the flattery, like a little fool,
I went to work, and bitterly did I rue the
day. It was a new ax, and I toiled and
tugged, till I was almost tired to death. The
school bell rung, and I could not get away;
my hands were blistered and it was not
half ground. A t length, however, the ax
was sharpened, and the man turned to me
with, ‘Now, you little rascal, you've played
the truant - scud to school, or you'll rue
it.' Alas, thought I, it was hard enough to
turn grindstone, this cold day; but now to
be called ‘little rascal was too much. It
sunk deep in my mind, and often have I
thought o f it since.
Poor Robert concludes with a moral
about over-politeness and excessive per­
suasion: ‘When I see a merchant overpolite to his customers, begging them to
taste a little brandy and throwing half his
goods on the counter thinks I, that man
has an ax to grind. ’
The true originator of the phrase is
undoubtedly Charles Miner, not Ben­
jamin Franklin.
The first essential is to examine the source
o f the testimony. Did the person reporting
the fact observe it himself? I f so, was he
in a position to observe accurately? Had
he any motive fo r reporting falsely, or for
embellishing what he saw? Was he a

The phrase was coined by Lord Beaverbrook, then British Minister for Aircraft

‘unsung heroes’ of the war effort, made
on March 24,1941: 'To whom must praise
be given? I will tell you. It is the boys
in the back room. They do not sit in the

bacon: to bring home the bacon
to succeed, to win a prize; to earn enough
money to support one’s family
Two delightful possibilities are suggested
as origins of this idiom.
For centuries, catching a greased pig
was a popular sport at country fairs. The
winner kept the pig, as the prize, and
brought home the bacon. Funk (1950)
quotes the 1720 edition of Bailey’s dic­
tionary, in which bacon is defined in the
narrower context of thieves’ slang as ‘the
Prize, of whatever kind which Robbers
make in their Enterprizes’. This implies
that at the least bring home the bacon
would have been understood at that
period.
Alternatively, there could be a connec­
tion with the Dunmow Flitch. In A D I 111
a noblewoman, Juga, wishing to promote
marital felicity, proclaimed that a flitch,
or side of bacon, should be awarded to
any person from any part of England who
could humbly kneel on two stones by the
church door in Great Dunmow, Essex
and swear that ‘for twelve months and a
day he has never had a household brawl
or wished himself unmarried’. Between

bacon

1244 and 1772 only eight flitches were
bestowed, for as Matthew Prior
remarked, ‘Few married folk peck
Dunmow-bacon’ ( Turtle and Sparrow,
1708). Sadly, with the recent closure of
the local bacon factory, the custom,
revived at the end of the nineteenth cen­
tury, has ceased.
None of this historical evidence is con­
clusive, but it is convincing enough to dis­
count, in all probability, the attribution
to Tiny Johnson. Her son, boxer Jack
Johnson, defeated James J. Jeffries on
July 4, 1910. She said after the fight in
Reno, Nevada, ‘He said he’d bring home
the bacon, and the honey boy has gone
and done it.’ Her use of the idiom may
well have popularised it, rather than orig­
inated it.

both an Old Dutch word for ‘bacon’ and
Anglo-Saxon for ‘back’. There is another
connection between back and bacon: it is
the pig’s back which is usually cured for
bacon, while the legs become hams.
This said, Brewer suggests the phrase
might allude to guarding the bacon stored
for the winter months from the household
dogs.
As the entry to bring home the bacon
explains, in the colloquial language of the
early 1700s bacon meant ‘prize’. Bailey
comments on to save one's bacon: ‘He has
him self escaped with the Prize, whence it
is commonly used fo r any narrow Escape.’
Grose in 1811 also defined bacon as
thieves’ cant for ‘escape’. This third
option appears to be the best, and earli­
est, source for the expression.

Many a time I ’ve given him a tip that has
resulted in his bringing home the bacon
with a startling story.

It was a sad and sober Oswald who that
evening beheld the fairy world o f Russian
Ballet. True, he had the check in his
pocket. True, he had saved his bacon for
the time being, but at what a cost! Some­
how the glory had faded from the Ballet.

The first, quite plausible suggestion for

techniques. Bakers (and other tradesmen
such as printers), when not selling direct

to the public, gave a thirteenth loaf (or
book) to the middleman. This constituted
his profit.
The most popular suggestion, however,
is that in thirteenth-century England,
bakers had a bad reputation for selling
underweight loaves. Strict regulations
were therefore introduced in 1266 to fix
standard weights for the various types of
bread, and a spell in the pillory could be
expected if short weight was given. So
bakers would include an extra loaf, called
the ‘vantage loaf’, with each order of
twelve to make sure the law was satisfied.
Such was the medieval baker’s unpopu­
larity that he became the subject of a tra­
ditional puppet play in which he was
shown being hurried into the flames of
hell by the devil for keeping the price
of bread high and giving short weight.

Although the practice is long-standing,

received his baptism o f fire.' It must have

to the drum and took their orders from
its beat. Retreat was one such order and
would sound each evening. It was a signal
for the soldiers to get behind their lines as
darkness fell and for the guards to present
themselves for duty. Of course, if fighting
were taking place but things were not
going well, the retreat would sound to
signal to the army to withdraw.

In a hunt beaters are employed to thrash
the bushes and undergrowth in order to
frighten game from its cover. It is they
who beat about the bush; the huntsman
is more direct or, in the words of George
Gascoigne (1525-77), ‘He bet about the
bush whyles others caught the birds.’
My mother came round one day and said,
‘My God, you're growing so boring! A ll
you talk about is children and schools you have to do something, dear. ’ She
didn't beat about the bush, she was lovely.

Creativity
Language is a very productive thing. New words - neologisms - are coming
into existence all the time, to such an extent that there are now several
dictionaries of just new words, and new editions and supplements to
long-established dictionaries. Many of the neologisms, though, die out
fairly quickly. Catchphrases, fads, gimmicks hold the popular fancy for a
short while and then disappear. Others meet a particular need and survive
whilst they have a function to fulfil. For instance, verbs come from nouns
quite commonly. This process has been going on for centuries. If we go
back as early as 1606, there’s ‘to eavesdrop’, which comes from ‘eaves­
dropper’, and right back to 1225 when ‘to beg’ came from the word
‘begard’ or ‘beggen’.
These are new words derived from existing words, a phenomenon that
applies to idioms as well. For instance, the expression to be in the red means
‘to be in debt and to have an overdraft’. It comes from the accountancy and
bookkeeping practice of using red ink to indicate debts. It was first found
around 1920. By analogy, amounts in credit are indicated in the black.
’ The iron curtain of the post-war era, popularised by Churchill in a
speech on March 5, 1946, in its turn gave rise to the bamboo curtain,
metaphorically dividing the West from mainland China.
There is another phrase which is productive in the same sort of way. In
Victorian times, the ‘uniform’ of an office worker was a black coat. So
the phrase grew a black-coated worker. This referred to his social status
and security in a good job - perhaps as a clerk in an office. That was in
Victorian England, and it has been suggested that in the turmoil of the
First World War period an American counterpart of the British phrase
arose: the white collar worker. The synonym could perhaps have been
formed by analogy.
It is interesting to see how in more recent years there have been other
extensions to this phrase. We find now the blue collar worker. There
is an example in Webster’s American dictionary of this: They refer to
warehousemen, longshoremen, farmers, miners, mechanics, construction
workers and other blue collar workers. It was first found in about 1950 in
America and came across the Atlantic in about 1958. There is at least one
more stage in the story. Since then, people have begun to refer to pink
collar jobs - low-paid jobs mainly for women, such as cleaners, hair­
dressers, waitresses.
The desire to be creative and productive with language permeates every
aspect of it: idioms are no exception.

when I needed it most. He told me what I
didn't want to hear and didn't beat about
the bush - he was brutally honest.'
S U N , May 18, 1992.

usage: Beat around the bush is also found.

beaten track: off the beaten track
away from the normal, the ordinary; geo­
graphically removed
The countryside is criss-crossed by many
footpaths and bridleways trampled down
and beaten hard with the passage of time
and many feet. This phrase is now a
favourite with holiday tour operators,
who exhort potential clients to take a
long-haul holiday away from the over­

The wrong side of the bed is the left.
According to a superstition that goes back
to Roman times, it is unlucky to get out
of bed on the left side because that is
where evil spirits dwell and their influence
will then be with you through your wak­
ing hours. Someone who is expecting to
be the butt of a malevolent spirit’s whims
throughout the day is thrown into an irri­
table frame of mind from the outset and
so, when a person is in a bad temper, he
is accused of getting out o f bed on the
wrong side.
You rose on the wrong side o f the bed

usage: The phrase may be applied geo­

ened to the beaten track.

bee: to be the bee’s knees
to be or consider oneself superior to
others in some way
When bees climb inside the cup of a
flower, pollen sticks to their bodies. The
bees then carefully comb this off and
transfer it to pollen sacks on their back
legs. Some authorities believe that the
expression refers to the delicate way bees
bend their knees as they perform this
operation.
Rees, however, makes a strong case for
an alternative theory. He argues that,
although there has long been a preoccu­
pation with bees and their knees, which
has given rise to a variety of expressions

back as far as the 1920s when it was
coined as an amusing rhym^. He points
to the importance of rhyme, assonance

expressions and a vogue in the twenties
for combining features of the body or
articles of clothing with parts of animals,
to bizarre effect. Thus we also find the

In days gone by it was thought that bees
were single minded in their work and
always flew in a straight line back to the
hive. Unfortunately, this piece of country
lore has since been proved untrue.
There is a similar snippet of country
wisdom about crows, who are supposed
to fly directly to their intended desti­
nation, hence the expression as the crow
flies.

to be obsessed by an idea
The phrase has been in popular use for
over three hundred years. Whether the
metaphor alludes to the frenetic buzzing
of thought, like the protests of the
trapped bee, or the frenzied behaviour of
the wearer of the bonnet, convinced that
he will be stung at any moment, is up to
the reader to decide.

bell the cat, to________________

berserk, to go

to undertake a difficult mission at great
personal risk

to be in a state of wild and uncontrollable
fury

An ancient fable, related by Langland in
Piers Plowman (1377), tells of a colony
of mice who met together to discuss how
they could thwart a cat who was terroris­
ing them. One young mouse suggested
hanging a bell around the cat’s neck so
that its movements would be known. This
plan delighted the rest until an old mouse
asked the obvious question, ‘Who will
bell the cat?’
Scottish history records a very perti­
nent instance of the expression in action.
Members of the nobility at the court of
James III were suspicious of the king’s
new favourite, an architect named Coch­
ran. The nobles met together secretly
and determined to get rid of him, where­
upon Lord Gray asked, ‘Who will bell the
cat?’ Archibald Douglas, Earl of Angus
was prompt with his reply: ‘I shall bell the
cat.’ He did as he had promised, seizing
Cochran and hanging him over the bridge
at Lauder, an act which earned him the
nickname ‘Bell-the-Cat Douglas.’

Berserk
is
a
nineteenth-century
borrowing from Norse mythology which
tells of a fierce warrior who, casting aside
weapons and armour, would work him­
self into a murderous frenzy before plung­
ing into battle clad only in his bearskin
coat. This earned him the name Ber­
serker (from bern, ‘a bear’ and serkr, ‘a
coat’). Twelve sons succeeded him, each
named Berserker and each as furious and
reckless in battle as he.
Some Viking warriors who emulated
the example of Berserker and his sons
earned recognition of their prowess by
being referred to as berserkers. For the
story of a berserk Italian warrior, see like
billio.

‘Mrs and Miss Jennynge must bell the cat. ’
‘What have I to do with cats?’ inquired
Mrs Jennynge wildly. 7 hate cats. ’

Betty Martin: all my eye and
Betty Martin
A lot of nonsense
There are several suggested etymologies
for this phrase. Partridge found mention
of an actress, a certain Betty Martin, in
the eighteenth century. She apparently
used the exclamation ‘My eye!’ regularly.
Conveniently, she lived around the time
of the first written version of the full
expression, as recorded in the OED Sup­
plement: ‘Physic, to old, crazy Frames
like ours, is all my eye and Betty Martin (a sea phrase that Admiral Jemm fre­
quently makes use o f) .’ Perhaps Betty
Martin’s part was to help popularise an
originally nautical idiom.
The sea plays a role in another possible
derivation. Radford relays the tradition
that the nonsensical English represents a
British sailor’s garbled version of words
heard in an Italian church, ‘A h mihi,
beate M artini\ meaning ‘Ah grant me,
blessed St Martin’. In favour of this sup­
position is the well-attested practice of
Englishmen turning the unfamiliar into
something that is at least superficially rec­
ognisable. The Elephant and Castle, for
example, is reckoned to have come from
the Spanish Infanta de Castilla.
In yet another story Betty Martin was
a gypsy woman who had been taken
before a magistrate. After the policeman
responsible for her arrest had given his
evidence, the woman flew at him, dealing
him a hefty blow to the face and scream­
ing all the while that what he had said was
all my eye. The officer’s eye was badly
bruised in the incident and he was then
forced to endure much teasing from the
public, who would call after him, ‘My eye
and Betty Martin.’ Responsibility for this
story lies with Dr Butler, one-time head­

Betty Martin

master of Shrewsbury school and later
Bishop of Lichfield.
A final possibility is suggested by Rees.
The linguistic device of rhyming slang
may account for the phrase’s popularity Martin does rhyme with fartin'\ The
idiom’s negative sense of ‘nonsense’ fits
quite well with the scatological fartin'.
The decision rests with the reader but,
as a last word, a certain Mr Cuthbert
Bede claimed in the December 1856 issue
of Notes and Queries that he had come
across the phrase in an old black-letter
volume bearing the title The Ryghte Tragycal Historie o f Master Thomas Thumbe.
If this is so, then the phrase could be some
four hundred years old.

with all longer idioms, it is often reduced
in length, to It's all my eye or even My
eye. This last form is particularly likely to
be an exclamation.

bib: best bib and tucker________
one’s best clothes
Bib brings to mind the cloth tied under a
baby’s chin to absorb the dribbles. In the
late seventeenth century, bibs of a sort
were also worn by adults to protect their
clothes from spills. A tucker was a
woman’s garment, this time a flimsy piece
of lace or muslin tucked into the top of
low-cut dresses and ending in a lacy frill
at the neck. Some authorities think that
in the expression best bib and tucker, the
bib referred to a man’s attire and the
tucker to a woman’s. Others consider that
the entire expression was originally only
used to describe a lady, dressed in all her
finery for a special occasion. The passage
of time and changes in fashion meant that
no one remembered what bibs and tuck­
ers were any more and so gradually the
term came to be applied to men as well.

C O B U IL D CO RPUS.

usage: Informal. To wear or be in one's
best bib and tucker are common alterna­
tive formulations.

Proverbs and idioms
Proverbs exist in all languages and
written collections of them date back
to the earliest times. A good example
is the Book of Proverbs in Jewish
sacred writings, which is of course also
found in the Old Testament of the
Christian Bible.
Proverbs are universally held in
high esteem, whereas idioms have had
to struggle for recognition. Perhaps
this is a little surprising, as there’s
some overlap between idioms and
proverbs. Proverbs can be defined as
‘memorable short sayings of the
people, containing wise words of
advice or warning’. Many idioms
share at least some of these character­
istics. For example, are a stitch in time
saves nine and more haste, less speed
better considered as proverbs or
idioms? Or better late than never, the
more, the merrier, out o f sight, out o f
mind, seeing is believing? Idioms or
proverbs? Proverbs, probably, but
two idiom experts feel that they can
class them as idioms without, as they
put it, ‘stretching the definition too
far’.
A further cause for confusion is the
capacity of an idiomatic phrase idioms are normally phrases, whereas
proverbs are whole sentences - to be
adapted into proverbial form. For
example, the phrase (idiom?) to cry
fo r the moon (see Moonshine, page
130), meaning ‘to ask for the imposs­
ible’, can easily become the full sen­
tence (proverb?) D on't cry fo r the
moon or, better, Only fools cry fo r
the moon.

G O O D H O U SEK EEP IN G , July 1992.

This expression goes back to the seven­
teenth and eighteenth centuries when all
gentlemen wore wigs. Some wigs, how­
ever, were bigger than others. Bishops,
judges and aristocrats, for instance, were
attired in the full-length wigs that present-day high court judges still wear.
Thus people of importance came to be
known as big wigs.
Some contemporary big wigs, however,
are becoming disenchanted with their
headgear. The first woman Speaker of the
House of Commons refused to wear her
wig on the grounds of comfort at work
and Lord Chief Justice Taylor thinks that
wigs and robes make the judiciary seem
out of touch and remote. Perhaps the
time is coming when, like other figures of
importance, they will be big wigs in name
only.

billio, like_____________________
with enthusiasm, with gusto
This expression of exuberance seems to
have originated in the nineteenth cen­
tury, according to Brandreth. Two appro­
priate theories have been advanced. The
first is that it makes reference to the
action of Stephenson’s steam engine, the
Puffing Billy. The second links the phrase
to Nino Biglio, a lieutenant under Gari­
baldi, who would plunge into the fray
exhorting his men to ‘follow me and fight
like Biglio’.
A third theory, that the phrase comes
from the name of Joseph Billio (a particu­
larly zealous Puritan and founder of the
Independent Congregation at Maldon,
Essex in 1682), is perhaps inappropriate
for a nineteenth-century term unless the
energetic Joseph managed to inspire a
revival in Maldon from beyond the
grave.

bird: a little bird told me_______
a secret source told me
Most authorities subscribe to the view
that this phrase is a biblical one and can
be found in Ecclesiastes 10:20: ‘Curse not
the King, no not in thy thought; and curse
not the rich in thy bedchamber: fo r a bird
o f the air shall carry the voice, and that
which hath wings shall tell the matter.’
There is a story which is an unlikely
origin but is worth telling for its charm.
All the birds were summoned to appear
before Solomon. Only the Lapwing did
not appear. When questioned on his dis­
obedience, Lapwing explained that he
was with the Queen of Sheba and that she
had resolved to visit King Solomon. The
King immediately began preparations for
the visit. Meanwhile Lapwing flew to
Ethiopia and told the Queen that King
Solomon had a great desire to see her.
The magnificent meeting, as we know,
then took place. Idiomatic little birds
have been English messengers since the
middle of the sixteenth century.

The ‘bit’ is the metal mouthpiece on a
horse’s bridle that enables the rider to
direct the animal. The horse is only sensi­
tive to the rider’s direction while the bit
is in the right place in his mouth. If he
takes the bit between his teeth he can no
longer feel the pull of the reins and the
rider has lost control of him.
The expression is a very old one, dating
back in Greek culture to Aeschylus in
470 BC: ‘You take the bit in your teeth,
like a new-harnessed colt.' It is in the He­
brew Wisdom literature of the Old Testa­
ment: ‘Be ye not like the horse, or like the
mule, that have no understanding, whose
mouth must be held in with bit and bridle,
lest they come near unto thee.’
The meaning through millennia has
been of obstinate self-will. Comparatively
recently, it has developed the sense of
determinedly setting out on a task, with­
out necessarily negative overtones.

bite off more than one can chew,
to____________________________
to try to do more than one can manage
or is capable of
An American phrase of late nineteenth-century origin. It probably refers
to the offering of a bite from a plug of
tobacco. A greedy man would naturally
bite off as much as he could but was then
unable to chew his mouthful comfortably.
According to Mark Twain, a humorous
ritual built up around tobacco chewing in
which a plug of tobacco would be offered
for a free bite. The biter would then take
off as much as he could fit into his mouth,
whereupon the owner of the plug would
gaze at the stump of tobacco which re­
mained and invite his friend to exchange
the plug for the piece he had bitten off.
One can easily imagine the playful pro­
hibition ‘Now, Tom, don’t bite off more
than you can chew’ as part of the ritual
conversation.
‘What did the voice say?’
‘It said - only it sounded much more
apocalyptic in the middle o f the night “Y ou’ve bitten o ff more than you can

thank for the modern expression:
\ . . his fellow warriors, many a one,
Fall round him to the earth and bite the
dust.’
English writers and translators before
Bryant used other words for ‘dust’:
ground (John Gay, Lord Byron,
Cowper) and sand (Pope).
The original meaning of the expression
was ‘to fall in battle’ but modern usage
has extended this and now almost any­
thing that has succumbed to disrepair or
failure, from a lawn-mower to a business,
is said to have bitten the dust.
A n d so another hero is about to bite the

bitter end, to the______________
to the very last, until overtaken by death
or defeat
The anchor cable on sailing ships was
coiled around the bitts, stout posts set in
the deck. The last portion of cable, which
was attached to the bitts themselves, was
known as the bitter end. Captain John
Smith explains it thus in his Seaman’s
Grammar of 1627: ‘A Bitter is but the
turne o f a Cable about the bitts, and veare
it out by little and little. A n d the Bitters end
is that part o f the Cable doth stay within
boord.’ If it were necessary to let out the
anchor cable to the bitter end, the likeli­
hood of disaster would be much greater,
since there would be nothing left in
reserve. It is probable, however, that the
phrase was influenced by a verse in the
Old Testament book of Proverbs, chapter
5, verse 4: ‘But her end is bitter as worm­
wood, sharp as a two-edged sword.’
Stockmar had told him that he must ‘never
relax’ and he never would. He would go
on, working to the utmost and striving fo r
the highest, to the bitter end. His industry
grew almost maniacal.

Black books have a very long history. The
earliest ones seem to be collections of the
laws of the times or of accounts of con­
temporary practice. The black books
referred to in the idiom are reports on
monastic holdings and allegations of cor­
ruption within the church, compiled by
Henry VIII during his struggle to sever
his kingdom from Papal authority. The
first one listed monasteries that were
alleged to be centres of ‘manifest sin,
vicious, carnal, and abominable living’.
In the light of this ‘evidence’, Parliament
was persuaded in 1536 to dissolve them
and assign their property to the king.
In roughly the same period, black
books were also held by medieval mer­
chants who kept records of people who
did not pay for goods. Black lists were
compiled of men who had gone bankrupt.
In 1592 Robert Greene wrote in his Black
Bookes Messenger, ‘Ned Browne’s
villanies are too many to be described in
my Blacke Booke.’
Later, Proctors of the Universities of
Oxford and Cambridge took to keeping
black books which listed the names of stu­
dents guilty of misconduct. So did mili­
tary regiments. No one in them could go
on to a degree or higher rank.

Shepherds dislike black sheep since their
fleece cannot be dyed and is therefore
worth less than white. Shepherds in
earlier times also thought that black
sheep disturbed the rest of the flock. A
ballad of 1550 tells us that T h e blacke
shepe is a perylous beast’ and Thomas
Bastard, writing in 1598, accuses the poor
animal of being savage:
Till now I thought the prouerbe did but
iest,
Which said a blacke sheepe was a biting
beast.
Market forces, superstitions and preju­
dices have prevailed and the term is now
applied to anyone who does not behave
as the rest of the group thinks fit.
We’re poor little lambs who’ve lost our
way,
Baa! Baa! Baa!

In black and white
In some areas of life, in art or the church for instance, black symbolises evil. This
is reflected in such idioms as the black arts, black magic, a black-hearted villain,
and we say something is as black as the devil or as black as hell. They all have
overtones of evil and wrong-doing.
Black is also associated with illegality. There’s the black market, of course, and
an ever-increasing black economy where transactions are never declared to the
Inland Revenue. Much older expressions, such as to fly the black flag and blackmail
(originally an illegal protection racket), contain the same idea of breaking the law.
Evil and illegality obviously bring moral censure and disgrace. Not surprisingly
then there are plenty of phrases expressing this idea: to be in someone’s black
books, to blacklist, to blackball or just to black someone, a blackleg, the black sheep
of the family, a black m ark, and so on.
Black is associated with death in most cultures and this probably explains the
gloomy connotations of the word in relation to human feelings. You can be in a
black humour or mood, look on the black side o f things, paint things in black
colours and claim that things are looking black. Other expressions connecting black
with feelings aren’t much better. To give somebody a black look and to look as
black as thunder suggest anger and threat.
On the other hand, white has had generally positive connotations: a white wed­
ding, for instance, or that old phrase That’s white o f you, meaning ‘That’s fair of
you’. White has the power to turn something bad into something good. Lying,
witches and magic all have negative associations, yet add the positive word white
and they are rendered harmless, even beneficial: a white lie, a white witch and white
magic.
Conversely, there are quite a few negative expressions connected with white. A
coward may be white-livered, be shown the white feather or surrender by waving
the white flag.
None the less, it is generally true to say that in English black indicates bad whilst
white indicates good.

Every privileged class tries at first to white­
wash its black sheep; if they prove incorri­
gible, they’re kicked out.

Blue Ribbon, the
the highest distinction, the pick of the
bunch
The most desired Order of Knighthood in
Britain is the blue ribbon of the Garter.
It is conferred by the Sovereign. By ex­
tension, the expression the blue ribbon
connotes excellence and the highest
honour. It is usually used in conjunction
with something quite outstanding.
The Blue Ribbon o f the Turf, for
instance, is the Derby. Lord Beaconsfield
apparently originated the phrase in the
splendid quotation from his Biography

o f Lord George Bentinck, given below.
The Blue Ribbon o f the Atlantic has the
alternative form the Blue Riband o f the
Atlantic - see The Old Curiosity Shop of
Linguistics (page 108).
Less common forms are the Blue
Ribbon o f the Law (the office of the Lord
Chancellor) and the Blue Ribbon o f the
Church
(the
Archbishopric
of
Canterbury).
There is an interesting parallel case in
French. Cordon bleu means ‘blue
ribbon’. Honours conferred on knights of
the Order of the Holy Spirit (L ’Ordre du
Saint Esprit) were suspended from this
ribbon. The development of meaning
took a rather different path in France,
however. These chevaliers by association
became known as cordons bleus. They
had a reputation for excellent food, so un
repas de cordon bleu was really out of
the ordinary. English has since borrowed
the term, such that we now refer to
cordon bleu cooking and chefs.
Lord George had given up racing to
become the leader o f the Conservative
party, and was defeated in Parliament a
few days before the horse Surplice, which
he had sold, won the coveted prize. The
two events troubled him greatly.
‘It was in vain to offer solace, ’ says
Disraeli.
He gave a sort o f stifled groan. ‘A ll my
life I have been trying fo r this, and fo r
what have I sacrificed it? You do not know
what the Derby is, ’ he moaned out.
‘Yes I do; it is the Blue Ribbon o f the
Turf. ’
‘It is the Blue Ribbon o f the Turf, ’ he
slowly repeated, and sitting down at a table
he buried himself in a folio o f statistics.

was copied in Paris in 1590 when a club
called Bas-bleu, ‘Blue-stocking’, was
begun and proved very successful among
ladies of learning. It was not until about
1750 that London had a similar society.
This was founded by Lady Montagu who,
tired of the trivial social round of cards
and gossip, opened her house to likeminded intellectuals and invited promi­
nent literary figures of the day to share
their ideas. Emphasis was on learning and
discussion, not on fashion and it was soon
noticed by smart society that one member
of the circle, Benjamin Stillingfleet,
habitually wore his everyday blue

showed more blue beneath their paler

A question of colour
Some years ago there was a fascinating piece of research done by two
anthropologists in America. After looking at ninety-eight different lan­
guages they found that contrary to contemporary views there were univer­
sal basic colour terms. Some languages had as few as two basic colour
terms, whereas others could have up to eleven. Not only that* but lan­
guages acquire colour terms in a fixed order. For instance, any language
with only two basic colour terms, such as Jale in New Guinea, must have
black and white. A language with three basic colour terms must have
black, white and red. One with five colour terms must have black, white,
red, green and yellow, and so on.
The evidence seems strong that this is how languages in general acquire
their basic colour terms. Idioms including colour terms, however, show
some characteristics that are difficult to explain in terms of universals of
language. Perhaps that’s not surprising, since one fundamental character­
istic of an idiom is that it breaks the rules of language. Rather, the evi­
dence from them points to each language expressing a unique world view
by the way it slices up reality into its own relative categories. For instance,
why do we say to be in the red in English, yet to be in the green in Italian?
Why is a blackleg in English a yellow in French and Spanish? And why is
to be in someone’s black books in English to be in the green book of
somebody in Spanish?
One particularly interesting example is that of the blue joke or ‘dirty
story’. In Spanish this can be a red story or a green joke. Yet in French a
blue tale means a ‘fairy story’. However, still in French, a green story or
even a green as a noun does mean our blue story. But a German who tells
blue tales is lying - perhaps telling a white lie?
So individual are languages, so much do things change from language
to language, that several authorities have suggested that a good test to
decide if a given phrase is an idiom or not - and this applies to all idioms,
not just colour idioms - is to see if it translates directly into another
language. If it does, it’s not an idiom. If it doesn’t, it is.
Better ways to decide what constitutes an idiom are considered in What
is an idiom? (see page 6). However, the translation test highlights the
peculiarity and idiosyncrasy of different languages as a basic criterion for
definition, which in turn lends support to what is known technically as the
Sapir-Whorf hypothesis. This argues that languages - and, it seems from
the limited evidence above, idioms also - are the unique product of their
immediate context and do not obviously obey universal rules.

or opinion
The end of the eighteenth century saw a
revolution in shoemaking: for the first
time cobblers were beginning to make
‘right’ and ‘left’ shoes. Before then shoes
could be put on either foot, so if one boot
pinched and rubbed excessively the obvi­
ous thing to do was to try it out on the
other foot to see if it suited better.
Here . . . the boot is on the other leg, and

bombshell: to drop a bombshell
to disclose disturbing news or information
Various metaphors have taken root from
the basic military term. One concerns a
piece of news that has an impact like that
of a bomb going off. Another, in the ex­
pression a blonde bombshell, suggests
that the stunning good looks of a woman
with blonde hair (not usually any other
colour) have a startling effect on those
who see her.
Our golden years were just about to begin
when Peter dropped a bombshell: all our
married life he had been having affairs.

A few years ago Speelman - then ranked
number five in the world - caused some­

three-ranked Short. This time the boot was

usage: Bombshell can never be shortened
to the virtual synonym bomb and retain
the same sense. Blonde is rarely spelt
blond - appropriately since in this case
it is borrowed from the French feminine
form and refers to a woman.

The etymology ought to be more exciting
but has nothing to do with stylish foot­
wear. Boot in this phrase comes from the
Anglo-Saxon bot which means ‘advan­
tage’ or ‘profit’. The word was current
until the early nineteenth century but has
since fallen out of use, surviving only in
this phrase meaning ‘in addition’ or, liter­
ally, ‘for a profit’.

brass tacks: to get down to brass
tacks_________________________
to bring the essential facts under dis­
cussion, to get to the heart of the matter
The phrase would seem to be American
and, probably, nineteenth century,
although its origins are obscure. The most
common suggestion is that the wooden
countertop in a draper’s store would have
brass-headed tacks hammered into it at
carefully measured intervals. The cus­
tomer who had got to the point of having
her cloth measured out against the tacks
was about to make a purchase and was
really getting down to business.
The expression, however, seems to
suggest a removal of layers in order to
reveal the tacks. Two suggestions from
different American authorities cover this
implication.
The first is that the brass tacks may
refer to those used by upholsterers to fix
the fabric and wadding in place. Any
defect in the furniture or renewal of the
upholstery meant stripping it down to the
brass tacks to sort the problem out.
The second suggestion is that the
expression originated in the shipyard and
referred to the cleaning of a ship’s hull, a
process which involved scrubbing off all
the barnacles to reveal the bolts which
held the structure together. The exponent
of this theory admits that such bolts
would be of copper and not brass and that
a tack is rather a flimsy fastening with
which to secure a ship, but puts this down
to American understatement for humor­
ous effect.
Rhyme might also come into the story,
if only to reinforce the meaning: ‘hard
facts’ conveniently is similar in sense and
rhymes with ‘brass tacks’. However, it is
unlikely that rhyming slang is the full
explanation of the etymology.

bread: the best thing since sliced
bread_________________________
the best innovation for some time
Rees (1990) mentions a clever advertise­
ment of Sainsbury’s from 1981: ‘Sainsbury’s brings you the greatest thing since
sliced bread. Unsliced bread.’
These days we pour scorn on the taste­
lessness and spongy texture of the prod­
uct which we take so much for granted,
but when it first appeared, in 1925, it
caused quite a stir. The loaves, neatly and
hygienically wrapped in waxed paper,
were produced by a bakery founded in
1840 by Henry Nevill. When sample
loaves from the Nevill bakery were put
on show at the Wembley Exhibition, they
were greeted with such excitement that
other businesses were swift to board the
bandwagon and invest in the machinery
required. The 1950s brought the forma­
tion of large bakery groups which started
to produce vast quantities of sliced bread
to meet a growing demand. Loaves now
came in a plastic wrapper and were sold
through supermarket outlets.
It is not known when the phrase the
best thing since sliced bread first became
popular. It may have been during the
early years of the product or perhaps
when sales started to boom in the 1950s
and the work of the housewife was made
just that little bit easier.

I work as a technician in a secondary
school where we have 21 Macs. The staff
think the machines are the best thing since
sliced bread and use them all the time fo r
their work.
M A C U SE R , May 1, 1992.

usage: It can be the greatest, best or even

breadline, on the
very poor, having almost nothing to eat
On the breadline originated in America
during the last century. Poor people
queued for free or cheap bread (line is
American for ‘queue’), so the phrase
gained the general meaning of ‘destitute,
bordering on starvation’. A specific story
about the possible origin concerns the
Fleischmann family and the bakery busi­
ness they ran in New York, in the 1870s.
The bakery was renowned for the fresh­
ness of its fare, a reputation won by the
fact that all the bread left on the shelves
at closing time was given away to
the poor. The queue of hungry people
which stood outside the shop each
evening became known as the breadline.
Mr David Fryer o f the University o f Stir­
ling interviewed people who had recently
lost their jobs and found that even those
far from the breadline felt cut o ff from
their peer groups.

break: a good/bad/lucky break
a good/bad opportunity, chance
The most likely origin seems to come
from pool, though the source suggested
for to give someone a break is also a possi­
bility here. In pool, the game begins with
the balls arranged in a set position. The
first player then uses the cue ball to break
this formation. The ‘break’ is largely a
matter of chance, the skill coming into
subsequent play. With a good break a
skilful player can go on to pocket many
of the balls and build towards a winning
position; a bad break gives the other
player an opportunity to play. A lucky
break is easy to understand as an exten­
sion of the basic idea.
Even with the girl's full co-operation the

The phrase may well be a piece of under­

he would pass round the hat for the audi­

community and by the nineteenth century

buck: to pass the buck_________
to pass the responsibility on to someone
else
A poker term which refers to the marker
(buck) which was placed in front of a
player as a reminder that it was his turn
to deal. The dealer has the unenviable
task of declaring the first stake and may
choose to pass the marker on, thus avoid­
ing the responsibility. Some say that the
original marker was a buckhorn knife,
hence the word buck. An alternative
explanation - perhaps a complementary
one - is that in the early West of America
a silver dollar was used as the marker. As
everyone knows, the informal term for
dollar is buck, so the passing on of the
dollar was literally passing the buck. This
monetary use of buck has been wide­
spread since the mid-1800s. John Bakeless in Master o f the Wilderness (1939)
explains why: ‘Skins were classified
[around 1800] as “bucks” and “does”, the
former being larger, and more valuable.
Americans still refer to dollars as “bucks"
. . . echoing the business terminology o f
their ancestors. ’

US President Truman had a sign on his
desk in the White House which read, ‘the
buck stops here’, indicating that he was
prepared to take full responsibility for
every decision made under his presi­
dency. Later presidents, Ford and Carter
among them, have echoed his intent by
quoting the phrase after announcing
weighty decisions. Gerald Ford used it,
for example, when deciding to pardon
Richard Nixon.
In straits like these, the wrestler with des­
tiny is tempted to look fo r bugbears and
scapegoats to carry the burden o f his own
inadequacy. Yet to ‘pass the buck’ in
adversity is still more dangerous than to
persuade oneself that prosperity is ever­
lasting.

bull: to take the bull by the horns
to face up to a difficulty with boldness
Although bull-running once took place in
England it was made illegal in 1840, so
since the phrase has only been in use from
the beginning of the nineteenth century,
it probably alludes not to this but to the
Spanish sport of bull-fighting. Early in the
fight the bull is tormented and enraged
by the banderilleros who pierce his neck
muscles with darts. As a result, the bull’s
head droops, making it easier for the
matador to play him along with his cape,
sometimes grasping his horns before
finally killing him.
Nora would have faced the difficulty, and
taken the bull by the horns.

Similes are figures of speech which compare two things, using the words as or like.
Sometimes the comparison is very unflattering or redolent with negative conno­
tations. There are* plenty of idiomatic English similes that fit into this category.

chauvinism implicit in many idioms. For much more overt dislike of foreigners, see

like a red rag to a bull: Spanish bull fights are well-known throughout the world.
The brave matador shakes his cape in front of the bull’s nose, enraging it. It was
believed that the red lining of the cape excited the bulls and made them even more
fearful opponents. Sad to say, it appears that bulls are colour blind and react to
the movement of the cape, not to its colour. However, that was not widely known
when the Spanish bull-fighting practice found its way into our simile like a red rag
to a bull.
The phrase is used to mean ‘likely to cause great annoyance or anger’, as in this
example from a nineteenth-century magazine: ‘George II hated books, and the sight
o f one in a drawing room was as a red rag to a bull. ’ It is often used in connection
with people who get angry very quickly.
like a bull in a china shop is also uncomplimentary. The china shop refers to shops
which have existed since the sixteenth century when traders started bringing back
fine porcelain from China. The power of the image lies in the juxtaposition of the
clumsy bulk of the bull with the delicacy of the china. The phrase applies to
somebody who is very awkward physically and keeps knocking things to the floor
and breaking them. By extension it can be used of anyone behaving in a rough,
assertive way.

usage: Burning one’s boats is probably
more frequent than one’s bridges. The
phrase emphasises the high risk element:
a daring venture in the first place, made
still more hazardous by an ‘all or nothing’
action.

E.

The idea of burning away oil in the pur­
suit of learning and creativity is not
uncommon in classical literature. In his
Life o f Demosthenes, Plutarch speaks of
the orator’s meticulous care in compo­
sition, then writes: ‘For this many of the
orators ridiculed him, and Pytheas in par­
ticular told him, “That all his arguments
smelled of the lamp.” Demosthenes
retorted sharply upon him: “Yes, indeed,
but your lamp and mine, my friend, are
not conscious to the same labours.” ’
The phrase as we know it today has
been in use since at least the mid seven­
teenth century and, in the following cen­
tury, Gay had occasion to use it more
than once, as in this passage from Trivia
which describes bookstalls in London
streets:
Walkers at leisure learning’s flowers may
spoil,
Nor watch the wasting o f the midnight
oil.
Even in these days of electricity and light
bulbs the phrase has remained current to
describe those, especially students, who
write or study far into the night.

During the Second World War, the RAF

‘Gone for a Burton’ featured in advertise­
ments of the period. Friends were not
said to have gone to their deaths, they
had just gone out for a beer.
Nowadays the phrase has lost its associ­
ation with death. Instead it is commonly
used to refer to objects which are broken
beyond mending (vases, lawn-mowers,
cars) or to hopes, dreams and plans that
are shattered.
A nd in case that didn’t knock Eros for

bury the hatchet, to

busman’s holiday, a___________

to restore a relationship after a long quar­
rel, to make up

spending one’s holiday doing the same
thing one would be doing at work

When American Indians negotiated the
cessation of hostilities, each party would
ceremonially bury a tomahawk to seal the
pact. In the New England Historical
Register of 1680 Samuel Sewall writes of
one such ceremony, this between Indians
and white men: ‘Meeting with the Sachem
they came to an agreement and buried two
Axes in the G round;. . . which ceremony
to them is more significant and binding
than all Articles o f Peace, the Hatchet
being a principal weapon.’
Of course, the tomahawks could always
be dug up again, and this meant renewed
aggression.

At the turn of the century when buses
were horse-drawn, it was not uncommon
for a driver to spend his day off riding on
his own bus to check that the relief driver
was treating his horses properly. Such
devotion must surely have played its part
in confirming the British as a nation of
animal lovers. The first use in print,
according to Brandreth, in The Times of
1921 referred to the expression’s prov­
erbial nature, suggesting it had been in
common currency for some while.

I don't know what you'll think sir-1 didn't
come to inquire But I picked up that agreement and stuffed
it in the fire;
A nd I told her we'd bury the hatchet
alongside o f the cow;
A nd we struck an agreement never to have

It was the kind o f hair, he could see, which

last fo r ever. I sometimes get a client as
early as the m ilk.' In her enthusiasm and

A nautical term referring to a sailing ship

combination of two old sailing terms,
each with a specific meaning. By means
‘close-hauled’, ‘to within six points of the
wind’, where the wind is before the beam
- as in the old phrase full and by. Large
means ‘with the wind on the quarter’,
‘abaft the beam’, as in the seventeenthcentury phrase to sail large. So, the join­
ing of these two technical nautical
expressions suggests the wind both before
and behind (‘abaft’) the beam: a little of
each, an average of them. There is also
the implication of taking the rough with
the smooth. Hence, someone who speaks

Many authorities believe that the phrase
has its origins in a late nineteenth-century
amusement devised by black slaves in
Southern US plantations in which partici­
pating couples promenaded about the
room arm in arm. The pair judged as
walking and turning most gracefully were
given a cake as a prize. The admiring cry
‘That takes the cake’ meaning ‘That wins
the prize’ gave rise not only to the ex­
pression but also to the name of the enter­
tainment, the cakewalk.
However, Stevenson quotes Aristo­
phanes as far back as the fifth century BC,
who writes in The Knights: ‘I f you surpass
him in impudence, we take the cake.' A

room to swing a cat, therefore, meant that
there was not enough space available for
this activity.
A more common theory is that the ‘cat’
in question was the cat-o’-nine-tails, a
whip with nine knotted thongs which was
used as a punishment in the British navy.
No room to swing a cat refers to the
cramped conditions on board ship which
made the lashing difficult to administer
properly. Funk (1950), however, rejects
this explanation, since the phrase was in

cat: to grin like a Cheshire cat
to smile constantly and foolishly
The mysterious Cheshire cat makes an
unforgettable appearance and disappear­
ance in Lewis Carroll’s A lice’s Adventures
in Wonderland. In the story, the Cheshire
cat is seen completely but then gradually
fades away until all that remains is its
grin. Carroll’s book is so well-known that
it is inevitable that the invention of the
remarkable animal should be attributed
to him. However, the Cheshire cat
existed long before Carroll wrote about
it and stories about its origin abound.
Cheshire is famous for its cheeses, and
some say that long ago the cheeses were
either made in the shape of a grinning cat,
or had the head of a cat stamped on them.
Alternatively the Cheshire cat might
refer to the unsuccessful efforts of a
Cheshire sign painter to represent the lion
rampant on the coat of arms of an influ­
ential county family. The results looked
more like a grinning cat than a roaring
lion and became the subject of much
hilarity.
Finally, Ewart tells the story of one of
Richard I ll’s gamekeepers named
Caterling, a burly monster of a man with
a wide and unpleasant grin. Originally the
simile was ‘to grin like a Cheshire
Caterling’ but, as time went by, economy
of effort reduced ‘caterling’ to ‘cat’.
A faint trace o f God, half metaphysical
and half magic, still broods over our
world, like the smile o f a cosmic Cheshire
Cat. But the growth o f psychological
knowledge will rub even that from the
universe.

cat: to let the cat out of the bag
to divulge a secret inadvertently
Unscrupulous vendors in medieval
markets would display a sample of their
wares openly then give the customer a
bag, already packed, tied and ready to
take away. If a hare or a pig were shown
for sale, the bag might contain a cat. The
wary customer who opened his bag to
check his purchase would discover the
deception and let the cat out o f the bag.
The secret would be out.
See a pig in a poke.
Reading one’s own poems aloud is letting
the cat out o f the bag. You may have
always suspected bits o f a poem to be over­
weighted, overviolent, or daft, and then,
suddenly, with the poet’s tongue round
them, your suspicion is made certain.

He was afraid, being a little affected with
wine, [he] would *let the cat out o f the
bag’.

At the beginning of the fourteenth cen­
tury the idea of being nice and close to
someone was expressed by ‘cheke by
cheke’. It was not until the second half of
the sixteenth century that ‘cheek by
iowle’ put in an appearance. Jowl means
‘jaw’ or ‘cheek’, so the phrase changed
only in form, not meaning. The
expression has had a number of dialectal
forms over the centuries (Norfolk has jigby-jole and Ayrshire cheek fo r chow) and
it is likely that the ultimate origin lies in
one of these regional uses. There is
another school of thought that prefers a
French origin, but evidence for it is
scarce.
Books have a way o f influencing each
other. Fiction will be much the better fo r

chip: a chip off the old block
a child who is very like its father in
character or appearance, or both
The reference here is to a chip hacked
from a block of wood. The chip is from
the same wood as the block, as the child
is of the same stock as the parent. The
metaphor is age-old: Theocritus in
270 BC preferred a chip o f old flint for
the same concept, which hints that one
variant or other of the phrase might go
back to the Stone Age.
John Milton used one English form in
1642: ‘How well dost thou appear to be a
chip o f the old block?’ Edmund Burke
commented on the occasion of William
Pitt the Younger’s first speech in Parlia­
ment, on 26 February 1781, that he was
‘not merely a chip off the old block, but
the old block itself’. Pitt was just twentyone years old. Some three years later he
was to become Prime Minister.

Competition can take many forms - ath­

‘They are not my sort o f guys . . . I

One of the relay quartet, Derek Red­
mond, responded: ‘There's a saying
among the athletes that Linford is the most
balanced runner in Britain because he's
got a chip on both shoulders. You can
understand why with comments like that.’

Splitting one’s sides
Did you hear the story about the dog that went to the local flea market and stole
the show? Or perhaps you heard of the young man who stayed up all night, trying
to work out where the sun went when it went down. It finally dawned on him.
Comedians are very grateful for one characteristic of idioms, for they get a lot
of laughs from its operation. Just about all idioms have a quite straightforward,
literal meaning and an idiomatic meaning.
Part of the art of the comedian lies in leading you to expect one interpretation
and then suddenly forcing you to switch over to the other. For instance, we hear
of the dog going down to the local open-air flea market. A little unusual, perhaps,
but quite possible in the context of a comedian’s ‘patter’. But the addition of stole
the show completely changes things. Here we have to decide whether the dog stole
the show, that is, ‘captured the limelight, became the centre of attention’ (the
idiomatic sense), or whether the whole sentence now becomes literal. The dog
went to a market where fleas were on display and stole that display, stole the show
of them.
Similarly with the second story. Is the meaning ‘the sun finally came up at dawn’
or is it ‘the solution finally came to him’? Again, the humour comes from the
ambiguity of interpretation that the listener is faced with.
If those were two terrible plays on words, there are others that are even worse:
‘I've got my husband to the point where he eats out o f my hand, it saves such a
lot o f washing up. ’
‘Waiter, bring me something to eat, I could eat a horse. ’
‘You couldn't have come to a better place, sir.'
‘What goes “Ha Ha B onk"?’
‘A man laughing his head off. '
‘What lies on the sea bed and twitches?’
‘A nervous wreck.'
On the same principle, the poet gets his effects by playing on the tension between
the literal and idiomatic in humorous verse, as in this limerick:
There was a young lad o f Montrose
who had pockets in none o f his clothes.
When asked by his lass
where he carried his brass,
he replied, 7 just pay through the nose.’

This phrase has its roots in the poverty
of the nineteenth century amongst those
who slept rough. For just two pence each,
poor people could buy a night’s lodging
on the two-penny rope. This was a bench
where these unfortunates would sleep sit­
ting up, their bodies slumped over a
clothes line stretched taut before them.
The morning brought a rough awakening,
for the landlord would often cut the rope
to wake his impoverished guests before
sending them on their way.

Occasionally, if we stop to think, we
are aware of the story behind an
idiom. The Bible tells us how Pontius
Pilate gave way before the pressure of
the mob and handed Christ over to be
crucified: He took some water, washed
his hands in front o f the crowd, and
said, 7 am not responsible fo r the
death o f this man, this is your doing. ’
(Matthew 27:24).
The same sense of refusing to
accept any sense of responsibility, of
withdrawing from a situation, occurs
commonly today, as in this extract
from Angus Wilson: 7/, o f course, you
are going to regard every suggestion I
make as a criticism, ’ he said, ‘then I
wash my hands o f the whole matter. ’

For this phrase we need to look to the
ancient Greek story of Theseus and the
Minotaur. The Minotaur was a terrible
beast, half-man and half-bull, which lived
in a huge and complicated Labyrinth on
the island of Crete. The king wished to
be rid of the monster but no champion
ever came out of the Labyrinth alive.
They were either killed by the Minotaur
or lost in the maze of corridors. Theseus
determined to slay the Minotaur. When
he entered the maze he took with him a
ball of thread which he unwound and let
out as he groped his way down the dark
corridors. After a mighty struggle,
Theseus killed the monster and was able
to find his way safely out of the Labyrinth
by rewinding the ball of thread.
Originally, clue, or clew, meant ‘ball of
yarn’ but, as the story of the Minotaur
gained popularity, the word took on a
new meaning, that of a means to solving
a puzzle.

cock a snook at someone, to
to show defiance, contempt or opposition
The phrase describes snooks, the disdain­
ful gesture of putting the end of the
thumb of one hand on the tip of the nose
and spreading out the fingers. Although
this sign of contempt only came about
during the last century its origins are
unknown. Today the expression can be
applied to any show of contempt and
need not be accompanied by the gesture.

cold feet, to get________________
to feel anxious and uncertain about an
undertaking, to the point of wanting to

According to an old Lombard proverb
known in England in the seventeenth cen­
tury through Ben Jonson’s play Volpone
(1605), to have cold feet signifies ‘to be
without means or resources’, a reference,
perhaps, to the fact that the destitute can­
not afford shoes. If this is the root of our
modern idiom, it is not evident how the
expression came to mean ‘nervous and
uncertain’, although it has been proposed
that a novel by Fritz Reuter (1862), in
which a card-player pleads ‘cold feet’ as
his excuse for backing out of a game,
might have influenced this shift in
meaning.
Instead o f ‘getting cold feet’, as the phrase

In medieval times the welcome guest to

Although

The best explanation for the use of cold

By analogy, the withdrawal method was
the most basic and straightforward.
Cold turkey - instantaneous withdrawal is the method usually used in jails to take

because we had no choice; we could not
administer the withdrawal drugs they use

Battleships always fly their colours, that
is, their national ensign. If the flag were
taken down, it was a sign of surrender. A
flag literally nailed to the mast, however,
showed the determination of the crew to
fight on, come what may. Today the
phrase is used to show a person’s determi­

There are several suggestions as to why
this Midland town lends its name to the
idiom.
The first claims that during the English
Civil War (1642-1649) supporters of
Parliament in Birmingham rose against
small groups of their fellow citizens who
were known to have pledged allegiance
to the Crown. Some they killed, others
were sent as prisoners to neighbouring
Coventry, a town which was staunchly
pro-Parliamentarian. This story comes
from a passage in Clarendon’s True His­
torical Narrative o f the Rebellion and Civil
Wars in England. Whether the facts can
be relied upon or whether they are
coloured by the author’s own royalist per­
suasion, the description of the events
includes the words ‘and sent them to Cov­
entry’. The literal sense has since become
a figurative expression of ostracism.

couch potato, a________________
someone living life with minimum effort;
an inactive TV addict
A recent American idiom that has rapidly
caught on in the UK. This is probably
because of the colourful metaphor of the
stereotypical TV addict who leads a vegetable-like existence in front of the ‘box’,
sitting on his couch. As for the choice
of potato as the vegetable, one can only
hazard the guess that it has a reputation
of a dull, inert and shapeless mass - just
like the obese TV watcher.

A transatlantic duo
In my office I have a little device for heating water in a cup so I can have a cup of
coffee whenever I feel like it. It’s not very solid, so I have got a couple of elastic
bands round it to hold it together. It’s very much of a Heath Robinson contraption.
That expression comes from William Heath Robinson, who specialised in the first
half of this century in drawing cartoons of elaborate and ingenious machines.
Across the Atlantic the same sort of fantastic invention, a needlessly complicated
gadget, is known as a Rube Goldberg, after the Pulitzer prize-winning cartoonist.
He, too, worked in the first half of the twentieth century.
A second theory is that the towns­
people of Coventry so disliked having sol­
diers garrisoned in their town that if a
woman was caught speaking to one she
would instantly be shunned by her neigh­
bours. The soldiers, of course, had no
desire to be sent to Coventry where social
contact was so difficult. No one knows at
what period this aversion to soldiers is
supposed to have arisen but the phrase
was well known by 1777. It has been sug­
gested that this also happened during the
turbulent period of the Civil War.
Collins (1958) suggests that the term
might be linked to the ‘covin-tree’, an oak
which supposedly stood in front of a
former castle in Coventry in feudal times
and was used as a gallows. Those to be
executed were sent to the covin-tree. The
town’s name, Coventry, may derive from
lcovin-tree\

crocodile tears
a show of hypocritical sorrow; insincere
tears
According to ancient belief the cunning
crocodile arouses the curiosity of its
unsuspecting victims with pitiful sighs and
groans. Once its prey is within reach of
its powerful jaws, the crocodile snaps it
up and devours it, shedding insincere
tears of sorrow all the while. Pliny and
Seneca both give rather fanciful accounts
of the crocodile’s wiles and crocodile’s
tears is used figuratively to refer to a show
of false emotion in both Greek and Latin.
It is not surprising that, before travel and
exploration
became

people were prepared to accept the
ancient belief. In 1356 Sir John Maundeville wrote his Voiage and Travaile. This

curry favour, to_______________
to seek someone’s approval through flat­
tery, to ingratiate oneself with someone
The phrase is a corruption of Middle Eng­
lish to curry favel or fauvel, itself from the
Old French estriller fauvel, meaning ‘to
rub down or groom a chestnut horse’.
Fauvel derives from the French fauve,
meaning ‘fallow-coloured’. In a four­
teenth-century French allegory, Le
Roman de Fauvel, a fallow horse, rep­
resenting hypocrisy and deceit, is care­
fully curried, or smoothed down, by other
characters in order to gain his favour. The
popularity of the work led people to
accuse those intent upon furthering their
own ends by flattery of currying favel.
Through the closeness in pronunciation
between ‘favel’ and ‘favour’ and the link
in meaning, it is not surprising that the
phrase became to curry favour.
In order to curry favour with the Grand
Duke, who might at any moment become
Tsar, the Schouvalovs encouraged him to
bring to St Petersburg a detachment o f his
Holstein troops.

Formerly anchor cables on sailing vessels
were made of hemp. If a naval warship at
anchor were in danger of enemy attack
and needed to make a speedy departure,
the crew would not take the time to wind
in the anchor but would simply cut
through the cable and then let the ship
run before the wind.
Thus spake Bavaria’s scholar king,
Prepared to cut and run:

dark horse, a_________________
an unknown quantity, a person whose
abilities are not yet known and tested
Benjamin Disraeli is credited with bring­
ing this racing term to public attention.
His novel The Young Duke (1831) con­
tains a description of a horse race in
which the two favourites cannot make the
running while ‘a dark horse which never
had been thought o f rushed past the grand­
stand in a sweeping triumph.’ In the com­
petitive world of horseracing, owners
sometimes like to conceal the potential of
a promising young horse until it has been
tried on the racecourse. A dark horse is
one whose form has been withheld from
public scrutiny in this way.
By extension the phrase might simply
be used to describe someone who has not
yet had the opportunity to show what he
can do. It is also applied to candidates for
an election or for a job who are not well
known but who might well be appointed.
This particular use owes a lot to the elec­
tion of James Knox Polk to the Presi­
dency in the USA in 1844. More likely
candidates for the Democratic nomina­
tion could not muster the required
number of votes, so the compromise can­
didate, the relatively unknown dark horse
Polk, came through. A few years later, in
1860, Abraham Lincoln was a similar
dark horse compromise candidate for the
Republican Party.

devil: between the devil and the
deep blue sea
trapped between two equally difficult sets
of circumstances
Despite first appearances, there is no
satanic influence behind this phrase. All
authorities are agreed that it is a nautical
term but differ on the details. The devil
was either a seam or a plank on a wooden
sailing ship but opinions vary, even in
sailing manuals, as to where it actually
was. Some say it was an outboard plank
on the upper deck, others that it was a
seam in that same place and still others
that it was a seam close to the water level.
Whatever it was, seam or plank, it was an
awkward place to reach and a precarious
place to be. Pity the poor sailor, then,
to whom it fell to caulk the devil and its
difficult seams. Perched between the devil
and the deep sea he ran a grave risk of
plunging, unnoticed, into the waters
below. The original form did not contain
blue, which was added later for emphasis.
The expression the devil to pay, mean­
ing that unpleasant consequences will
surely follow a course of action, probably
has the same nautical origin.

Friendly fire is a term familiar
primarily to the military since at least
the Vietnam War, and more widely
since the Gulf War of 1991. However,
being under fire from one’s own side is
as old as warfare itself. It certainly
happened to Colonel Robert Munroe,
a Scotsman in the middle of a battle in
the 1620s. He was with a Scottish regi­
ment that was serving under a Swedish
commander. During one engagement
he found himself exposed not only to
the fire of the enemy in front of him,
but also to Swedish guns at his back.
The guns weren’t sufficiently elevated.
So the cannonballs from them were
falling short, killing Scottish soldiers,
not the enemy. No wonder Colonel
Munroe wrote afterwards ‘I with my
party did lie on our post as betwixt the
devil and the deep sea.’

or powers received there is always a price
to pay later. Halliwell in about 1400 has:
Beit wer be at tome fo r ay,
Than her to serve the devil to pay.
(Reliquae Antiquae)
The second explanation is probably more
persuasive. There is plenty of evidence
that this idiom is part of a longer nautical
expression, the devil to pay and no pitch
hot. The devil here is a seam or a plank
on a ship - for a full account see between
the devil and the deep blue sea. ‘Pay’ is
from the Old French peier meaning ‘to
caulk’. If the devil were not caulked
because the pitch had not been heated
through, the necessary maintenance
could not be done and revenue would be
lost through the vessel’s not being sea­
worthy. The consequences would be
severe - just the sense of the contempor­
ary idiom.

W ILLIAM SH A K E SPE A R E , Richard III, 1592.

Many suppose the phrase to have some­
thing to do with the Victorian novelist
Charles Dickens. This is not the case. The
word has been in use since the sixteenth
century. It is a euphemism for ‘devil’ and
may be a contracted form of ‘devilkin’.

People, page 104.
So wherever this wretched word [impracti­
cal] occurs Ym left wondering what the

usage: The phrase can be used in a variety
of ways: What the dickens, how the
dickens, the dickens I will, a dickens o f
a . . . It is as flexible as the word hell that
it euphemistically replaces. It should not
properly be written with an initial capital.

die is cast, the
an irrevocable step has been taken
The phrase is a translation of ‘Jacta alea
est’, words attributed to Julius Caesar as
he crossed the Rubicon and committed
himself to war with Rome. Although it
is his momentous use of the expression
which we recognise, he was, in fact, quot­
ing a well-known Greek proverb to be
found in the writings of Meander as early
as 300 BC.
The meaning of the phrase speaks for
itself. All dice games carry an element of
chance and, once the die has been
thrown, the player must reconcile himself
to the outcome, whether favourable or
not. The die cannot be thrown again.
See to cross the Rubicon.

dodo: as dead as a dodo
dead, extinct, obsolete, out of date
The dodo was a peculiar, comical-looking
bird with a large, hooked bill, and short,
curly tail-feathers. Heavy and clumsy, the
dodo was flightless, its small wings being
totally out of proportion to its bulky
body. Its name comes from the Portu­
guese doudo meaning ‘silly, stupid’.
There were two known species, one
unique to each of the islands of Mauritius
and Reunion in the Indian Ocean. Sadly,
the increase in exploration and trade in
the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries
brought about the extinction of the dodo.
Seamen and colonists found the cumber­
some creatures both tasty and easy to
catch. The settlers introduced pigs to the
islands, which destroyed their nests and
young as they foraged. By the close of the
seventeenth century the luckless bird was
extinct.
There is a curious after-effect of the
extinction of the dodo. The tambalacoque tree flourished in Mauritius and
Reunion up to the time of the demise of
the dodo. No new seeds would germinate.
By the 1970s, only thirteen tambalacoque
trees were left in the world. It is known
that many seeds will only germinate if
they pass through the digestive system of
a certain animal. It seems the tree’s seeds
need the dodo! As an experiment, an
American expert used turkeys as a

doldrums, in the
depressed, low in spirits
The origin of the form of the word doldrum is thought to lie in the Old English
word dol meaning ‘dull’. As for the mean­
ing, there are two schools of thought.
Early in the nineteenth century, and
probably before, in the doldrums was
used as a synonym for ‘in the dumps,
depressed’. Later sailors borrowed the
phrase to describe the region of sultry
calms and baffling winds within a few
degrees of the Equator where the north­
east and south-east trade winds converge.
Here the progress of sailing ships would
be greatly delayed for many days, their
crews becoming frustrated and demoral­
ised through inactivity. Hence their feel­
ings provided the name for the area.
Other authorities suggest that the
reverse is true: the idiom is derived from

a friend you hadn’t seen for a long period

the original expression, but quite a
mouthful. Economy of effort together
with a certain play on words gave us the
current form of the expression, donkey’s
years, which is neater if misleading.

It is to be expected that preoccupation
with death will give rise to a number of
euphemisms and similes. Over recent
centuries people have been as dead as
mutton, a mackerel, a herring, a nit and
even Queen Anne (the day after she d y’d).
Strangely, the oldest expression of them
all, dead as a doornail, used in William o f
Palerne around 1350, is the one which has
best survived into modern usage.
Medieval doors were studded with
large-headed nails, but it is not easy to
understand why the comparison with a
doornail should have arisen unless the
nail in question were that which was
struck by the knocker. Anything repeat­
edly pounded in this fashion would defi­
nitely be dead.

Such a very evocative phrase seems to call
for a pleasing etymology. Instead, dumps
is no more than a borrowing from North­
ern European languages. Swedish has
dumpin, ‘melancholy’; Dutch has dompig, ‘damp or hazy’; and German has
dum pf', meaning ‘gloomy, damp’ - all
depressing stuff.
Nevertheless, the usage is old. People
have certainly been in the dumps since
the early sixteenth century and perhaps
even earlier. A ballad thought to have
been composed by Richard Sheale about
1475 has the line: ‘I wail, As one in dole­
ful dumps.’ Singing the blues is not a

Sir Stephen Rice, Chief Baron of the Irish
Exchequer, is credited with coining this
phrase around 1670 in his vigorous oppo­
sition to the Act of Settlement. According
to Archbishop King, it was a term he
employed often in this context:
He was (to give him his due) a man o f
the best sense among them, well enough
versed in the law, but most signal fo r his
inveteracy against the Protestant interest
and settlement o f Ireland, having been
often heard to say, before he was a judge,
that he would ‘drive a coach and six horses
through the act o f settlement, ’ upon which
both depended (State o f the Protestants o f
Ireland).

The original allusion to a duck with
clipped wings or injured webbed feet
seems to have been applied to someone
who could not pay his debts on the Stock
Exchange: ‘Frauds o f which a lame duck
on the stock exchange would be ashamed’
(Macaulay, Mirabeau, 1841). The great
actor Garrick apparently coined the
phrase in a play he wrote in 1771: ‘Change
Alley bankrupts waddle out [like] lame
ducks.’ Stock Exchange slang then

Dutch courage
courage found by drinking alcohol, cow­
ardice
Dutch courage is an expression of con­
tempt implying, as it does, a bravery that
is alcohol-induced. A magnificent,
though short-lived, victory over the
Dutch at the battle of Lowestoft during
the Second Dutch War brought
the following lines from the pen of
Edmund Waller and show what the Eng­
lish thought of the courage their adver­
saries displayed:
The Dutch their wine and all their brandy
lose,
Disarm’d o f that from which their courage
grows.
(Instructions to a Painter fo r a Picture o f
the Victory over the Dutch, 3 June, 1665).
For other anti-Dutch expressions dating
from the seventeenth century, see
National rivalries (page 76.)

Dutch: double Dutch
gibberish, incomprehensible speech
The contempt in which the English held
the Dutch in the seventeenth century is
evident in this phrase. It implies that the
Dutch language is unintelligible, nothing
more than gibberish.

National rivalries
Most nations seem to have a love-hate relationship with their neighbours.
The British tend to look with respect at French cordon bleu cooking
and admire French style in clothing, for instance. The English language
borrows many cooking terms from French and menus in expensive res­
taurants are commonly in French, too. An elegantly dressed lady may
be described as looking very chic - a word we have adopted from the
French.
But the British can be distinctly uncomplimentary about other nations.
Let’s just look at two cases, the Dutch and the French.
There are a number of expressions which speak of the Dutch in sneering
and critical tones. These phrases have their origins in the seventeenth
century when the Dutch were hated commercial and military rivals. The
extensive trading empire they had built up and the control they had over
the European carrying-trade were prejudicing the development of the
English economy. A literary example of the relations between the two
countries comes from John Dryden, who set out to fan the flames of
chauvinism with his tragedy Amboyna (1673). Amboyna was the name of
a place in the Moluccas, or Spice Islands, where some Englishmen had
been massacred by the Dutch in 1623.
The antipathy was very strong. Finishing off a remark with or I’m a
Dutchman implies the strongest possible confidence in the truth of the
statement, since the acceptance of the name ‘Dutchman’ would be the
ultimate disgrace. This example is from J. B. Priestley’s The Good Com­
panions (1929):
Now it's started, mark my words. Elsie’s nobbut the first, more to follow,
or I am a Dutchman.
Less commonly, a dutchman is a contrivance of builders to hide faulty
construction work. In a Dutch auction, everything is done the wrong way
round: the auctioneer starts at a highly inflated price, then slowly drops
the figure until someone indicates they accept it - quite the opposite of
the approved British way of starting at a low figure and allowing sub­
sequent bids to push up the price.
The consumption of alcohol is a frequent taunt (see Dutch courage). A
Dutch bargain is a one-sided one, struck during a drinking session. A
Dutch feast is when the host gets drunk before the guests and a Dutch
concert is a drunken uproar.

Even animals do not escape: a Dutch nightingale is a frog. Family
relationships, it seems, are the reverse of those in England, for to talk to
someone like a Dutch uncle, ‘to reprimand’, implies a stern relative, not
the amiable, indulgent British stereotype. A Dutch treat is when you pay
for yourself, as you do when you go Dutch. Such was the Englishman’s
opinion of Dutch practices and customs. Equally low is his respect for the
language: anything incomprehensible in English is described as double
Dutch.
By no means all of these expressions are still in common use, although
those chosen for entries in this book are well-attested in recent literature
and speech.
Strangely, the negative linguistic heritage left by many centuries of
rivalry between the British and the French seems smaller than that left
from the intense dislike of the Dutch which only lasted about a hundred
years.
There is that mock apology Pardon my French. Colloquially, it’s used
after some swearing or offensive language: the bad language isn’t English,
it’s my French that needs pardoning. Another example is to take French
leave, meaning ‘to go absent without leave or permission’, and it is a direct
reflection on the bravery, or rather the supposed lack of it, of French
soldiers. It is well-known that the French get their own back: the equiva­
lent phrase in French translates as ‘to sneak off in the way the English
do’.
Other fixed phrases imply a moral censure but also a grudging envy. The
French have traditionally had a reputation for sexual prowess, recorded in
a French kiss (with the tongue in the partner’s mouth), the French way
(oral sex), a French letter (a condom) and the French disease (venereal
disease). At the risk of extending the feuding, it is perhaps some small
defence to note that these terms might be a riposte to that Latin lover
Casanova’s use of language. In the eighteenth century, he was one of
the first to use prophylactic sheaths, calling them redingotes d’Angleterre
(‘English overcoats’) and since then the French have called them capotes
anglaises (‘English cloaks’).
If consolation were needed, blaming other people seems to be an inter­
national pastime. Just within the area of language, to an Englishman
unintelligible speech is, as we have seen, double Dutch or It’s all Greek
to me. To a Spaniard it is as if it were spoken in Greek, and to a Frenchman
it is Hebrew or even Iroquoianl To add insult to injury, anyone who
speaks poor French is said to talk like a Spanish cow.

An American phrase which came into
vogue about the time of the Second
World War. Some authorities say it orig­
inated amongst the American forces to
describe those keen recruits who volun­

American sources say it was widely used
in student circles from about 1940.
Beavers are reputedly industrious ani­

little rhyming phrase but one which car­

too hard to please.

ears: my ears are burning

A tingling or burning sensation in the ears
supposedly means that a person is being

belief goes back to Roman times when
augurs (see under the auspices of) paid
particular attention to such signs. Pliny
wrote:
It is acknowledged that the absent feel a
presentiment o f remarks about themselves
by the ringing o f their ears. (Naturalis Historia, AD 77).

The ancient belief that the left signified
‘evil’ and the right ‘good’ (see set o ff on
the wrong foot) applies here also. Both
Plautus and Pliny hold that if a person's
right ear burns then he is being praised,
but a burning left ear indicates that he is
the subject of evil intent. English litera­
ture, from Chaucer to Dickens, abounds
with references to burning ears.
According to ancient belief, other
unexpected bodily twitches and sen­
sations also, warn of events to come,
among them the eye and the thumb. A
flickering right eye, for instance, indicates
that a friend will visit or that something
longed for will soon be seen and a prick­
ing in one’s left thumb warns of an evil
event.

and guests enjoyed the venison. Because
those who ate umble pie were of humble
stock confusion arose between ‘umble’
and ‘humble’, so that the phrase we know
today means ‘to admit a wrong to the
point of humiliation’. Yet, even though
lowly folk have been tucking into their
‘umbles’ since the fifteenth century, the

egg on one’s face, to have
to look foolish having made a wrong
choice
Brandreth gives an American origin in
the 1960s and a British use in 1972. It has
certainly spread rapidly in this country,
mainly in journalism. Throwing eggs at
an opponent is not uncommon, especially
on the political hustings. The idea seems
to be that a politician with egg on his face
is made to look foolish. Metaphorically,
a decision that backfires leaves those
responsible with egg on their faces.

egg: to be a bad/good egg
to be
person

an

untrustworthy/dependable

It is impossible to tell from simply looking
at the shell whether an egg is fresh or not.
Once the egg is broken it may reveal an
unpleasant surprise, but a good egg will
be found to have been completely sound
right through to its very centre. So it is
with people; the outward appearance will
not reveal the content of the character.
This is only discovered when time is taken
to get to know a person better. Someone
who is a good egg is known to be depend­
able through and through. A bad egg is
someone to avoid.
The first written reference is to a bad
egg. It makes it clear that it was current
in spoken English for some time before:
7/i the language o f his class, the Perfect
Bird generally turns out to be “a bad
egg”.’ (Samuel A. Hammett, Captain
Priest, 1855.)
Good egg did not come into use until
the beginning of this century, when it was
probably coined amongst the students at
Oxford.

The remarks about the freshness of
eggs apply to
another common
expression, like the curate’s egg - good in
parts, which refers to something which is
mediocre but has its good points. The edi­
tion of Punch published on November 9,
1895 carried a cartoon showing a timid
curate eating a bad egg at the home of his
bishop and bravely assuring his host that
‘parts of it are excellent’. The simile is
sometimes halved so that good in parts
and like the curate’s egg may be heard
independently.

it will lay or not).

eggs has not been explained, unless it
was to decorate the empty shell. It has
been pointed out that a toothless grand­
mother would naturally be more success­
ful in this than a grandchild with a
complete set of teeth. Neither is it appar­
ent why this form of the expression rather
than the other more obvious ones should
have come down to the present day.
This said, the phrase is open to a cer­
tain amount of humorous embroidery.
R. D. Blackmore alluded to it thus: "A
. . . twinkle, which might have been inter­
preted - “instruct your grandfather in the
suction o f gallinaceous products” ’
(Christowell, 1882), and there is a little
Victorian ditty of unknown origin:
Teach not a parent’s mother to extract
The embryo juices o f an egg by suction:
The good old lady can the feat enact
Quite irrespective o f your kind instruction.
According to Partridge (1950), in later
years ‘egg’ became an underworld slang
term for a confidence trickster’s victim, in
other words for a ‘sucker’, a reference to
the expression under consideration.
This revolutionary idea is called Self
Evaluation. Fancy . . . Doesn’t everybody

fair game
someone or something which may be
attacked or ridiculed with good reason
Over the centuries there has been much
legislation to deter poachers and to
uphold the rights of landowners. The
reign of George III saw an abundance of
legislation, thirty-two Game Laws in all,
which were essentially introduced with
the motive of keeping hunting rights for
the aristocratic minority who justified the
laws by voicing fears that, without them,
game stocks would be severely depleted.
At the beginning of the nineteenth cen­
tury it was illegal for anyone except the
squire or his eldest son to take game,
even if they had been permitted to do so
by the landowner. A law of 1816 stipu­
lated that anyone taking so much as a
rabbit unlawfully should be transported
for seven years. Poachers became
increasingly skilful and landowners
fought back by setting man-traps, some
of which inflicted great damage, not only
upon the intended victim but upon inno­
cent passers-by.
The expression fair game was first used
in 1825 and, against this background of
abundant restrictive legislation to give the
ruling classes exclusive rights to the
countryside and its creatures, refers to

In England, too, bravery in combat was
rewarded by the wearing of a feather.
Knights who had shown outstanding val­
our in battle wore feathers in their hel­
mets. It is possible that the origin of the
phrase may be traced to one particular
early example, that of Edward, the Black
Prince who, at the age of sixteen, showed
such bravery in the Battle of Crecy (1346)
that the crest of blind John of Bohemia,
one of the mighty knights in the enemy
forces, was bestowed upon him. The
crest, three ostrich plumes, is the em­
blem of the Princes of Wales to this day.

feather: to show the white feather
to show cowardice
This is a phrase from the cock-pit. The
plumage of a pure-bred cock had no white
feathers in it. A cock with a white feather
in its tail was underbred and unlikely to
perform as well as the best of the breed.
Thus showing a white feather was
equated with cowardice. This was, of
course, a great defect as high stakes were
wagered on fighting cocks.
During the First World War it was the
practice of some women to give white
feathers to able-bodied men in civilian
clothes who they thought should have
been away fighting in the trenches.
A ll the rejected men talked like that. War
was the one thing they wanted, now they
couldn't have it. A ll o f them had a side­
long eye fo r the women they talked with,
a guarded resentment which said, ‘Don't
pin a white feather on me, you blood­
thirsty female. I ’ve offered my meat to the
crows and they won’t have it.’

feet of clay____________________
a weakness perceived in someone held in
high regard
This is a biblical expression and comes
from a story to be found in the Book of
Daniel. Daniel, after spending the night
in prayer, is the only wise man in Nebuch­
adnezzar’s kingdom who is able to tell the
king what his troublesome dream means.
In his dream Nebuchadnezzar sees a
huge and awesome statue made of differ­
ent metals starting with gold at the head
down to iron on the legs. The statue’s
feet are part iron and part clay. In the
interpretation Daniel tells the king that
by God’s will he is the golden head but
that other inferior kingdoms will succeed
him, ending with a divided kingdom rep­
resented by the feet of iron and clay:
A s the toes were partly iron and partly
clay, so this kingdom will be partly strong
and partly brittle. A nd just as you saw the
iron mixed with baked clay, so the people
will be a mixture and will not remain
united, any more than iron mixes with
clay. (Daniel 2:42, New International
Version.)
The mighty, awe-inspiring statue was
not as strong as it first appeared, its great­
est weakness being its feet o f clay. Even
the greatest - and superficially perfect have hidden flaws.
Mr Carlyle made an inimitable bust o f the
poet’s head o f gold; may I not be forgiven
if m y business should have more to do
with the feet o f clay?

usage: A literary cliche.
see also: Achilles’ heel

fiddle: as fit as a fiddle
on top form, in excellent health
The earliest reference to the expression
has been traced to William Haughton’s
Englishmen fo r My Money (1597): ‘This
is excellent, i’faith; as fit as a fiddle.’ In
the sixteenth century the word fiddle was
applicable not only to the instrument but
also to the fiddler and, by extension, to an
entertainer or mirth-maker. It is possible,
therefore, that the phrase describes the
fiddler, a vivacious character who made
the company merry and played his instru­
ment with vigour.
Supporters of the theory that the
phrase is really about the instrument, not
its player, point out that in past centuries
‘fit’ did not mean ‘healthy’ but ‘suitable
for a purpose’. So the phrase meant ‘as
suitable for its purpose as a fiddle is for
music-making’. They argue that the
phrase changed in meaning, and sub­
sequently became nonsensical, when ‘fit’
gradually came to be synonymous with
bodily well-being.
In the sixteenth century fine as a fiddle
was also found. Possibly people were
excited by the appearance of this new
instrument, for it was not until that cen­
tury that the fiddle in the form we know
it today came over from Italy. Certainly
the fiddle was admired, for an expression
a face made o f a fiddle was used, from the
seventeenth to the nineteenth centuries,
to describe someone with fine features.
By contrast, the only comparison that sur­
vives nowadays between the face and the
fiddle is a relatively recent one from the

85

turn of the century, to have a face as long
as a fiddle, and that means ‘to look mis­
erable’.
The epidural provided instant relief I feel
that if women have children they should
have anything to stop the pain, provided
it doesn't damage the baby. I had no prob­
lems afterwards, I felt tired, but fit as a

usage: Another phrase with a long history
that remains colloquial.

fiddle while Rome burns, to
to be occupied with trivialities while a
crisis is taking place
An old story alleges that in AD 64 the
Emperor Nero, in order to gain an
impression of what Troy had looked like
while ablaze, set fire to Rome, then sang
and played his lyre while he watched the
flames. It is said that the city burned for
six days and seven nights. Nero himself
denied the charge and put the blame upon
the Christians, whom he then persecuted
ruthlessly - first locally, then further
afield. His claim to innocence is sup­
ported by contemporary historians who
say he was far from the city at the time.
Tragedy has been stalking through this
house: doctors have been telephoned fo r,
sick rooms made ready, cool compresses
prepared: and here are you two young
men carelessly playing billiards. Fiddling
while Rome burns is about what it
amounts to.

filthy lucre

•

filthy lucre____________________
money, dishonourable profit
The middle English word lucre comes
from the Latin lucrum, ‘gain’. This in turn
has the root leu, ‘to win, to capture as
booty' which lends the meaning of
‘profit’, ‘booty’, ‘loot’, ‘value’ to different
words in a number of languages. The
word stands by itself to mean ‘dishonour­
able gain’ but is usually found with
the reinforcement of filthy. The phrase is
used three times in the Authorised Ver­
sion of the New Testament, in Titus 1:7
and in 1 Timothy 3:3 and 8. Indicative of
the rather dated air of the phrase is that
all the modern versions of the Bible
replace it by ‘money’ or ‘gain’.
I f a Jew wants to be a rich man, he is
apt to be keener about his business than a
Gentile; but if he has no ambition to make
money, and chooses to be a philosopher,
or a musician, he will often show a noble
indifference to filthy lucre, like Spinoza.

usage: The expression can still be used
with negative connotations but is much
more frequent today as a jocular term for
money.

finger: to have a finger in the/
every pie______________________
to play a part in doing something; to
interfere in a matter
There is an ellipsis in this expression. It
is better understood if read ‘to have a
finger in making the pie’, when the sense
of involvement becomes clear. There is
nearly always an implication of meddling
in other people’s business. This universal
human tendency has been reflected in this
phrase for at least four hundred years.

a brilliant initiative which amounts to
nothing
The expression comes from a misfunction
in the old flintlock gun. When the musket
was fired, a flint striking against the ham­
mer produced a spark which fired the
priming, a small quantity of gunpowder
held in the pan. This explosion ignited
the main charge, forcing the ball to fly
from the barrel. Sometimes the priming
caught but failed to ignite the main
charge, resulting in nothing more than a
flash in the pan. When this happened the
gun was said to be ‘hanging fire’, giving
rise to another idiomatic phrase meaning
‘slow to act’.

He is a fly in amber; nobody cares about
the fly; the only question is, How the devil
did it get there?
The connection of amber with oint­
ment is that, at one time, amber was the
word commonly used for ‘ambergris’,
which is an ingredient in some sweet­
smelling ointments. However, the senses
of wonderment, surprise and curiosity of
a fly in amber are not close to the meaning
of a fly in the ointment. In the Old Testa­
ment, in Ecclesiastes 10:1 we find: ‘Dead
flies cause the ointment o f the apothecary
to send forth a stinking savour.’ This is
very much the sense of the contemporary
phrase. So, in all probability, here is the
source of our modern expression.

fly in the ointment, a__________
something trifling that spoils or mars the

Funk (1950) suggests U.at an earlier ver­

fossilised in amber were the subject of
wonderment. Francis Bacon is one writer
who remarked on it:
We see spiders, flies, or ants entombed and
preserved forever in amber, a more than
royal tomb. (Historia Vitae et Mortis,
Sylva Sylvarum, 1623.)
There were many other similar com­

Herrick’s poem On a Fly buried in
Amber. Sydney Smith, in typical fashion,
wrote of Canning:

Authorities usually refer to the commonsense explanation which immediately

pavement.
A more interesting and reasonably
plausible suggestion is that the presentday idiom comes from a much earlier
phrase the bishop hath set his fo o t in it,
which was a common cry when broth or
milk was burnt. Bishops, it seems, were
not popular in the Middle Ages. Accord­
ing to William Tyndale:
I f the podech [soup] be burned to, or the
meat over-roasted, we say the Bishop hath
put his fo o t in the pot, or the Bishop hath
played the cook. Because the Bishops
burn who they lust and whosoever dis­
pleases them ( The Obedyence o f a
Chrysten M an, 1528).

Francis Grose, in his Provincial Glossary
(1790), suggests a different origin for the
phrase, claiming that many a pan of milk
burned while cottagers, on hearing that a
bishop was passing through their village,
dashed out into the street to implore a
blessing.
John Milton used the expression in
Animadversions (1641): 7/ will be the
bishop’s fo o t in the b roth/
Swift employed it almost a century later
in Polite Conversation (1738): ‘This cream
is burnt too - Why madam, the bishop
hath set his fo o t in it.’
Interestingly, the French had a phrase
of similar origin, pas de clerc (‘priest’s
footstep’), which was used when someone
had committed an indiscretion through
ignorance or lack of good sense.
Those who support the theory that the
expression has an ecclesiastical origin
point out that the roots of many idiomatic
phrases wither with the passage of time
and that this is no exception; all connec­
tion with the clergy has long since been
forgotten.

Although the expression was current

seventeenth century. In these circles it
was not considered impolite to leave a
social gathering without first making a
formal farewell to one’s host and hostess.
English society was stricter and was not
amused by the lax ways of its French
counterparts, so it seized uf jn the custom
to express the idea of ‘sneaking off with­
out permission’. The French, however,
have coined a phrase of their own which
carries the same meaning. Filer (or s ’en

Gauntlet, here, has nothing to do with
gloves. The word comes from the Swedish
gatulopp (gata ‘a lane’ and lopp ‘a chase,
running’). The early English forms were
to run the gantlope and to run the gantlet.
Running the gauntlet was a fearful military
punishment of Swedish invention in
which the offender, stripped to his waist,
was forced to run between two lines of
soldiers who beat him with clubs or ropes.
This torture came to the fore during the
Thirty Years War of 1618-1648. The
well-disciplined army of King Gustavus
Adolphus clearly impressed the British
military commanders. The navy im­
plemented the punishment in 1661, for
example, to deter theft from on board
ship. It was abolished in 1813 but its' use
had caught on in public schools where it
remained as a form of schoolboy bullying
until well into this century. Hammond
Innes tells of one particular experience of
his from the 1920s:

Hammer horror stories
Disregarding cartoons, Count Dracula has appeared in 133 feature films
and Frankenstein in ninety-one, according to a recent filmography. The
living dead, mummies, werewolves, aliens - all are themes prominent in
the cinema. Many of the plots and characters are drawn from literature,
where there is a long tradition of the macabre. In the nineteenth century
alone, within the conventions of the Gothic novel Mary Shelley published
Frankenstein in 1818; Edgar Allan Poe followed her in mid-century with
his Tales o f the Grotesque and Arabesque, the Pit and the Pendulum and
Murders in the Rue Morgue; Bram Stoker gave the world vampires and
werewolves in Dracula (1897). The side of human nature that likes to be
frightened by horror stories in film and print is doubtless the one that has
seized on the macabre in human actions and preserved it in idioms.
Superstitions have an element of the spooky about them. But why are the
spirits of the Druids relevant? Where do graves come into shivering? What
evil intent is associated with the left ear? For answers, see to touch wood,
someone’s just walked over my grave, my ears are burning.
Body-snatching from graves has a long tradition behind it. Dissection
of human corpses became legal in 1832. Soon afterwards, in 1845, Thack­
eray was referring to a skeleton in the cupboard and everyone knows
Robert Louis Stevenson’s 1886 novel The Strange Case o f Dr Jekyll and
Mr Hyde, since the inspiration for many films.
Many other expressions record man’s inhumanity to man. In some
instances, there is doubt about the grisly etymology: perhaps it is not
slitting people’s noses or hastening their death from hanging (see to pay
through the nose, to pull someone’s leg) but a (slightly) less distasteful
origin. In other cases, there is no doubt about the rigours of military
punishments (to run the gauntlet) or the viciousness of American gang
warfare (a hatchet job). It is hardly surprising that the pursuit of heresy
by fanatical religious adherents made such an impact on popular con­
sciousness that we have idioms today that stem from it (to haul somebody
over the coals, a baptism of fire). See Rights for animals! (page 205) for
the gruesome role animals sometimes play in idioms.
The taste for the macabre has always been with us. The image of a
sword hanging by a hair above its victim in the sword of Damocles finds
an echo in The Pit and the Pendulum and modern-day chillers from Holly­
wood. Even dictionaries might frighten - try reading the entries referred
to in this trailer, all alone, late one wild winter’s night.

A theory that convinces several etymol­
ogists says that gibberish comes from
Geber, the name of an Arabian alchemist
who lived in the eleventh century. He
invented a strange terminology of his own
so that his notes would not be understood
if found, and in this way he avoided any
accusation of heresy, which was punish­
able by death.
O ther scholars feel that this is an
unlikely root since the word is not spelt
geberish. Instead they advance a plaus­
ible, if much less entertaining, origin
which says that gibberish comes from
‘gibber’, a verb allied to ‘jabber’, mean­
ing to speak rapidly and unintelligibly.
The problem here is that gibberish came
into use before ‘gibber’. This forces an
investigation into the origins of ‘gibber’
which might be traced to ‘gabber’ and
‘gabble’, but do these bear any resem­
blance to gibberish? . . . and so the
debate continues.
He repeated some gibberish, which by the

goat: to get someone’s goat
to irritate, annoy someone
The phrase came into use early this cen­
tury in America where it was common for
a highly strung racehorse to have a goat
as a stable companion. Goats were
thought to have a calming influence on
nervy thoroughbreds. It seems that
attempts were sometimes made to sab­
otage a horse’s chance of success by steal­
ing the goat the night before a big race,
thus reducing the would-be champion to
a state of agitation. This, at least, is the
theory and, although it may be uncon­
vincing, no better one has been advanced.

A favourite story connected with this
phrase attributes it to King Eric XIV of
Sweden whose reign began in 1560.
According to an old chronicle:

fo o l o f a girl she was making a mistake,
but she wouldn’t listen to me. Well, she’s
cooked her goose now all right.

The Kyng ofSwedland coming to a towne
o f his enemyes with very little company,
his enemyes, to slyghte his forces, did hang
out a goose fo r him to shoote, but perceiv­
ing before nyghte that these fewe soldiers
had invaded and sette their chiefe houlds
on fire, they demanded o f him what his
intent was, to whom he replyed, ‘To cook
your goose!’

usage: Colloquial. Used either of thwart­
ing another’s plans by design, or of suffer­
ing the unintentional results of one’s own
ill-judged actions.

Unfortunately, no copy remains of the
old chronicle to testify to the antiquity of
the legend and the expression does not
seem to have been current before the
middle of the nineteenth century, when it
was used in a street ballad objecting to
the attempts of Pope Pius IX to revive
the influence of the Catholic church in
England by the appointment of Cardinal
Wiseman:
I f they come here we’ll cook their goose
The Pope and Cardinal Wiseman.
Funk (1950) is not convinced by this
explanation. He prefers the story
recorded in to kill the goose that lays the
golden eggs, where the aspirations of the
greedy peasants are frustrated.
‘I'm quite sure, ’ he cried, ‘that I could turn
out something better than most o f the stuff
that gets published. ’

goose: to kill the goose which lays
the golden eggs________________
to destroy a source of profit through
greed
In 1484 William Caxton translated into
English a fable by Aesop which tells the
tale of a peasant who had the good for­
tune to own a goose that laid golden eggs.
In his hurry to become rich he cut the
goose open to have all the eggs at once,
thus butchering his source of future
wealth. The moral Aesop intended was
that of being content with one’s fortune
and guarding against greed. It entered
English as the expression to kill the goose
which lays the golden eggs, meaning ‘to
make excessive demands on a source of
profit, such that it is ruined’.
An altered form of the expression, the
goose that lays the golden eggs, is also
sometimes found to refer to a valuable
source of income.
We’re all respectable householders - that’s
to say Tories, yes-men, and bumsuckers.

groggy: to feel groggy__________
to feel dizzy, unsteady, shaky
Until 1971 the officers and men of the
Royal Navy were entitled to a daily ration
of rum. In 1740 Admiral Vernon, dubbed
‘Old Grog’ because of the grogram cloak
he always wore, started to issue rum
diluted with water which the sailors called
grog after him. Men who could not take
their drink or perhaps drank others’
rations as well as their own would end up
feeling groggy or ‘drunk’. Today the term
could be used to describe someone suffer­
ing the after-effects of a party the night
before but is more likely to be used of
someone who was generally unwell.
The pheasants would be up in the trees by
then, roosting, and they’d be starting to
feel groggy, and they’d be wobbling and
trying to keep their balance and soon every
pheasant that had eaten one single raisin
would be a sitting target.

nests for rearing their young which
floated on the sea. Greek mythology tells
of the goddess Halcyone who, beside her­
self with grief when her husband was
drowned in a shipwreck, cast herself into
the sea. The gods, moved by her
devotion, brought him back to life,
changing both Halcyone and her husband
into kingfishers. Further, the gods said
that from that time whenever kingfishers
were brooding on their nests in the sea,
the water would be kept calm and no
storm would arise. According to legend,
kingfishers bred on the seven days before
and the seven days after the winter sol­
stice. These were halcyon days, guaran­
teed to be calm and fair.

ham actor

ham actor, a__________________
a poor actor with an exaggerated, unnatu­
ral style
Speculation, all of it quite plausible,
abounds over this little phrase. A favour­
ite theory is that the term is an abbrevi­
ation of hamfatter, an American word
dating from about 1875, which described
seedy, second-rate actors who, through
lack of money, were forced to use ham
fat to clean off their make-up. A variation
of this is that the ham fat was used as a
base for burnt cork by touring minstrels
wishing to black-up their faces. There was
also a well-known song from the George
Christie Minstrels days called ‘Ham Fat’,
which was all about an amateurish actor:
possibly the phrase came from this.
Another theory refers to Hamish
McCullough, nicknamed Ham and leader
of a troupe known as Ham’s Actors, who
toured Illinois around the 1880s giving
performances that were less than
wonderful.
If in doubt, try Shakespeare! Troilus
and Cressida (1601) has in Act 1, scene
iii:
Like a strutting player, whose conceit
Lies in his hamstring, and doth think it
rich
To hear the wooden dialogue and sound
’Twixt his stretch’d footing and the scaffoldage.
The unnatural, exaggerated gait that is
typical of a poor actor, Shakespeare sug­
gests, involves the excessive, peculiar
exercising of the hamstring, a tendon
forming part of the ham.
Maclean plays a Spanish inquisitor trying
to detect Jewish infiltrators with a plate o f
ham sandwiches. The 48-year-old veg­

etarian said: ‘I ’ve always been something
o f a ham actor. ’
T O D A Y , May 12, 1992.

usage: The phrase can be reduced to the
simple ham , with two different senses.
One continues the derogatory meaning of
ham actor but applies it to a third-rate per­
former of any kind. The other has no nega­
tive associations, in phrases like radio
ham , a short-wave radio enthusiast.

hang fire, to__________________
to be pending, delayed
This is an expression from the use of fire
arms. When the main charge in a gun was
slow to ignite, the gun was said to be
hanging fire. Now the term is used of
someone slow to take decisive action on a
matter to the frustration of all concerned.

with the destruction of a vineyard and in
Switzerland in the same century it was
claimed that a cock had laid an egg and
should therefore answer charges of sor­
cery. In an age when unhygienic con­
ditions were widespread, it was only to be
expected that dog bites would quite often
prove fatal, thus bringing about a charge
of murder.
A hangdog look originally described
the expression of someone considered fit
to hang, like a dog, for his crimes, but
has weakened to mean little more than
‘shamefaced’.
He, he!’ tittered his friend, ‘you are so so very funny!’

havoc: to play/wreak havoc
to devastate, destroy, spoil
Havoc was borrowed from the Old
French havot, meaning plunder. A shout
of havoc was an order, a war cry, a signal
for pillage and the seizure of spoil to
begin. The phrase cry havoc from *he
Anglo-French crier havok is especially
common in fifteenth- and sixteenthcentury texts, from its first use in 1419,
recorded in Excerpta Historica.
There are several references to havoc
and cry havoc in Shakespeare’s plays. In
Henry IV Part I (Act V, scene i) we hear
of ‘pellmell, havoc and confusion\ and in
Julius Caesar (Act III, scene i) come the
lines:
. . . Caesar’s spirit, ranging fo r revenge,
With Ate by his side come hot from hell,
Shall in these confines with a monarch’s
voice
Cry, ‘Havoc!’ and let slip the dogs o f war.
The other part of the contemporary
phrase, to wreak, also dates back to the
fifteenth century with the sense of ‘to
give vent to, to carry out by way of

to cry havoc died out, whereas to wreak
tended to collocate more and more with
havoc, hence the principal form of the
contemporary expression.

though, that this view is based on a mean­
ing of to go haywire which has not per­
meated into British English, that of
something being in general disorder, just
cobbled together.
Another American authority bases his
interpretation on the real purpose of hay­
wire, which is to bind up bales of hay.
Haywire is thin and easily bendable but
it is also very strong, requiring cutters to
break it. Once the tight wires wound
around a bale have been snipped, how­
ever, they spring apart and writhe wildly
and dangerously in the air, totally out of
control.
A third American source says the
notion of general disorder and confusion
alludes to the tangled mass of wire that is
heaped in a corner of the yard once it has
been cut off the bales.
Whatever the final make-up o f the Eng­
land side, Botham ’s medium pace will be

The phrase originated early this century

that the properties of lazy farmers who
cannot be bothered with permanent
repairs are virtually held together with

result is an untidy and chaotic mess. Such
places would be referred to as having
gone haywire. It should be pointed out,

Hobson’s choice_______________

The phrase, of Scottish origin, goes back
to around the turn of the century and
refers to pranks and frolics indulged in at
drinking parties. One game was to throw
dice to see who amongst the assembled
company should drink a large bowl of
liquor and who should then pay for it. A
passage from Walter Scott suggests that
high jinks was a game of forfeits:

no alternative, no choice at all

The frolicsome company had begun to
practise the ancient and now forgotten pas­
time o f high jinks. This game was played
in several different ways. Most frequently
the dice were thrown by the company, and
those upon whom the lot fell were obliged
to assume and maintain fo r a certain time,
a certain fictitious character, or to repeat a
certain number o f fescennine verses in a
particular order. I f they departed from the
characters assigned, or if their memory
proved treacherous in the repetition, they
incurred forfeits, which were compounded

Thomas Hobson (1544-1631) ran a livery
stable in Cambridge. Customers were
never permitted to choose their own
mount but were obliged to take Hobson’s
choice, which was always the horse near­
est the stable door. As Hobson moved his
horses round in rotation, he was thus able
to ensure that every horse was worked
fairly and that no animal was ridden too
often.
Hobson’s name survives not only in this
expression but in two epitaphs - by Mil­
ton, a student at Christ’s College, Cam­
bridge, at the time of Hobson’s death,
and in the street named after him in old
Cambridge.
Can any woman think herself happy,
that’s obliged to marry only with Hobson’s
choice?

since the early seventeenth century. It has
been suggested that they might be a Puri­
tan parody of the words of consecration
in the Latin Mass (Hoc est corpus meum).
According to Thomas Ady, in the time of
King James I there was one particular
man who called himself ‘The Kings
Majesties most excellent Hocus Pocus’ (A
Candle in the Dark; or, A Treatise Con­
cerning the Nature o f Witches and Witch­
craft, 1656). He is generally thought to
have been the author of the Latin phrase,
taking his name from it.
An alternative etymology, which has
some merit, is proposed by Todd in his
late eighteenth-century edition of Dr
Johnson’s monumental Dictionary o f the
English Language (1755). A famous
Italian juggler, Ochus Bochus, gained
such a reputation that other jugglers, and
then conjurors, repeated his name over
their tricks - perhaps for luck or to
impress a gullible public. Early uses of the
phrase are, indeed, often in the context of
jugglers rather than conjurors, as here:
One o f the greatest pieces o f legerdemain,
with which jugglers hocus the vulgar
(Nalson).
It could be, however, that the conjurors
were invoking a much older power. A
note to the Dragon King in James Fitz­
gerald Pennie’s Britain’s Historical
Drama of 1832 tells us that Ochus Bochus
was in fact a magician and demon among
the Saxons, dwelling in forests and caves

(the name still extant, according to one
etymology, in the Somerset place name
Wookey Hole, near Wells). Who, then,
knows what dark powers are being called
upon?
The reduced form of the phrase, hocus,
used as a verb, shows the origin of our
contemporary hoax. It is thought that
hanky-panky may also come from this
root.
The phrase has had various interesting
developments in America. H okum , ‘non­
sense’, is apparently a blend of hocus and
bunkum. It dates from 1917. A hokeypokey man is a salesman of cheap ice
cream or confectionery that masquerades
as something better than it is. This sweet
delight crossed the Atlantic and was
known in Victorian England.

People
There are quite a few people immortalised in English idioms. The stories
behind Hobson’s choice and Keeping up with the Joneses are dealt with in
detail under the appropriate entry. As queer, tight or fine as Dick's hatband
were originally taunts or insults referring to Richard Cromwell, son of
Oliver and Lord Protector from 1658-59, who never wore a crown.
We do not have such precise information on the origins of other
expressions. Who is Jack Robinson? Before you can say Jack Robinson
was first used in print by Fanny Burney in Evelina in 1778, in a way that
suggests the expression was well-known. A few years later, in 1811, Grose
in his Dictionary o f the Vulgar Tongue claims it originated from (a very
volatile gentleman o f that appellation, who would call on his neighbours,
and be gone before his name could be announced’. There are other ideas
that it might come from an old play, or have been made popular, at least,
by a poem of Thomas Hudson’s called Jack Robinson. But for all this
speculation, we are really none the wiser about who precisely Jack Robin­
son was - he’s just been a very popular character for over two hundred
years.
every Tom, Dick and Harry: This trio dates back to at least 1815 in
America, but alternative forms of the phrase, with variations on the names
used, are earlier. The obvious explanation is the best one: the commonest
names denote the man in the street, or that archetype of normality, the
man on the Clapham omnibus.
More fancifully, there might be a rather sinister explanation. Harry, as
in Old Harry, has for centuries referred to the devil. Similarly, so has
Dick - Heywood uses it thus in his Edward TV of 1599. It has been
relatively interchangeable over four hundred years with dickens, which is
still as familiar to us today as it was to Shakespeare in The Merry Wives
o f Windsor in 1601: I cannot tell what the dickens his name is. Tom,
however, has no known diabolical links, which tends to make this theory
fall apart. What a shame we do not have a trio of idiomatic euphemisms
for Old Nick himself!
It’s always nice to have the support of a famous person for our own views.
So it’s not surprising that we use the name of authorities and experts in
certain set phrases and associate them with our own opinions.

according to Cocker: A certain Mr Cocker wrote a mathematics textbook
that was popular in British schools for many years. So if anything was
described as according to Cocker it must be right and correct in all areas,
not simply mathematics. But as Cocker’s textbook hasn’t been used for
years now, this phrase is restricted primarily to older people.
according to Gunter: In America there is a parallel phrase according to
Gunter. Mr Gunter was another mathematician who in the early seven­
teenth century invented the standard measure for surveyors. This is
twenty-two yards long, divided into a hundred links, and called Gunter’s
Chain. From this grew the American phrase meaning ‘correctly, accu­
rately’.
Authorities in other fields have made their idiomatic mark. Edmond
Hoyle’s definitive statement of the rules of whist (1742) provided us with
according to Hoyle, which now has the wider sense of ‘according to the
rules’.
Conversely, some people commemorated in idioms have an unsavoury
reputation that it is not pleasant to be associated with. Who wants to be
described as a nosey parkerl It is likely that this expression refers back to
a specific person - Matthew Parker, the Archbishop of Canterbury under
Elizabeth I, is the prime candidate. However, it could be connected with
a dialectal verb to pauk, meaning ‘to be inquisitive’, or (as one eminent
etymologist suggests) with a park-keeper (a parker) officiously spying on
everything going on in his domain. Other characters are inventions of
fiction or age-old figures made known to us through the Bible.
a Mrs Grundy: Quite a lot of these phrases come from literature. Mrs
Grundy, for instance, is mentioned repeatedly in Thomas Morton’s play
Speed the Plough, first produced in 1800, but she never appears on stage.
The other characters constantly wonder what she will think or say, as she
is the type of lady who takes a rather narrow, very moral view of things.
She is somebody to be feared. As a poet once said: 'And many are afraid
o f God, and more o f Mrs Grundy.’
a Jeremiah: The Bible provides us with similar sorts of expressions. Jere­
miah, the Old Testament prophet, is popularly considered to be a fore­
teller of doom and disaster. Although his reputation for laments and
mournfulness is not really justified, that is the way we look at him today
and, by association, how we view anyone we call a Jeremiah.
From the Greek tradition, Cassandra is renowned as a similar prophet
of doom.

usage: The phrase is often hyphenated.
Usually used disapprovingly, because of
the connotations of trickery.
see also: hanky-panky

hog: to go the whole hog
to do something thoroughly
A number of theories have been
advanced for this phrase and there is also
some uncertainty as to whether it was
coined in America or England. Although
written use occurred first in the US in
1828 and in England soon after, there is
no way of knowing on which side of the
Atlantic it first gained spoken currency.
Speculation over the country of origin
is not clarified by the fact that, in the last
century, a hog was a slang term for a ten
cent piece in America but also for an Irish
shilling, so that, according to one theory,
to go the whole hog meant to be willing
to spend the whole amount on something.
As Brandreth aptly comments, this would
make the phrase a close relation of in fo r
a penny, in fo r a pound.
The poet Cowper apparently enjoyed
popularity on both sides of the Atlantic
and Funk (1950) suggests that a likely
origin is to be found in one of his poems,
The Love o f the World Reproved: or
Hypocrisy Detected (1779), in which he
discusses the strictures Muslims placed
upon the eating of pork. Mohammed pro­
hibited his followers from eating certain
parts of a pig but was singularly unclear
about what these were. Muslims were
wont to interpret his decree according to
their own personal taste so that, between
them, the whole hog was devoured:

Had he the sinful part express’d,
They might with safety eat the rest;
But fo r one piece they thought it hard
From the whole hog to be debar’d;
A nd set their wit at work to find
What joint the prophet had in mind.
Much controversy straight arose,
These choose the back, the belly those;
By some ’tis confidently said
He meant not to forbid the head;
While others at that doctrine rail,
A n d piously prefer the tail.
Thus, conscience freed from every clog,
Mahometans eat up the hog.
Each thinks his neighbour makes too free,
Yet likes a slice as well as he:
With sophistry their sauce they sweeten,
Till quite from tail to snout ’tis eaten.
A final theory - in Men and Manners in
America, dating from the first half of the
nineteenth century - is sure of the Ameri­
can origin. It claims that it was a term
used by butchers in Virginia who would
ask their customers whether they wanted
to go the whole hog or buy only parts of
the animal. The phrase was popularly
used in the wider context of thoroughness
in radical reform or democratic principle.
D on’t you think it would be more interesting if you went the whole hog and drew
him warts and all?

‘Hold the fort, for I am coming,’ is popu­

eral
William
Tecumseh
Sherman
signalled to fellow Union General John
Murray Corse as he faced a Confederate
attack at Allatoopa Pass on October 5,
1864, during the American Civil War.
What the signal from the top of Kenesaw
Mountain really read was ‘Hold out,
relief is coming’, but the misquote caught
popular imagination and soon appeared
in the spoken and written word. Philip
Paul Bliss wrote the words into the chorus
of a well-loved gospel hymn:
Ho my comrades! See the signal,
Waving in the sky!
Reinforcements now appearing,
Victory is nigh!
‘Hold the fort, fo r I am coming, ’
Jesus signals still.
Wave the answer back to heaven,
‘By thy grace we will. ’

ings in England in the 1870s.

method o f making sure that I did so was
to keep me a prisoner.
IRIS M U R D O C H , Under the Net, 1954.

An American source quotes evidence
from John P. Quinn’s book Fools o f For­
tune (1892) to support his theory that this
is a nineteenth-century American phrase
and comes from the poker tables in a
gambling den. The owners of the joint, it
seems, had the right to a percentage of
the money put down in stakes. For this
purpose, each table had a ‘hole’ or slot in
its centre. The proprietor’s due was
posted through this and collected in a
locked drawer beneath.
Although the expression can be used to
describe being in difficulty of any kind, it
is especially used in the context of finan­
cial problems. This theory would fit in
with this meaning, the allusion being to a
gambler who eventually finds he has put
more money in the hidden drawer than
he has left to his name.

The Old Curiosity Shop of Linguistics
Preserving old words
Delving into the etymology of words, and particularly idioms, has been
aptly described by the chairman of Harvard’s Department of Linguistics
as the Old Curiosity Shop branch of linguistic research. One French ety­
mologist entitled his book The Museum o f French Expressions. In that
shop or museum, there are some antiques that can no longer be found in
normal life (or language). Here are three examples:
To leave in the lurch: The old French lourche is the probable origin of a
medieval card game, lourche in French and lurcio in Italian, which was
somewhat similar to backgammon. On its arrival in England, some of
the vocabulary associated with it was translated into English: il demoura
lourche became ‘he was left in the lurch, he was so far behind that he had
no hope of winning’. This type of anglicisation is a common linguistic
process; see bandy about for the international travels and shifts of meaning
of the early French tennis term bander.
The original context of use was extended slightly when the phrase was
employed to describe the player of cribbage (a newly invented game)
whose opponent had reached sixty-one when he had not yet reached
thirty-one: he was left in the lurch - a hopeless situation. In time, the
usage widened much further and any sense of the origin in card games
was lost. The meaning, too, generalised to the contemporary ‘to be aban­
doned in difficulty’.
To be on one’s mettle: The word ‘mettle’ originally meant ‘temperament,
character, spirit’ or even ‘courage’. It is widely used in Shakespeare: he
describes one of his characters as a Corinthian, a lad of mettle: in other
words a man of some character. To be on one's mettle today has a related
sense of ‘to be in a position where one must do one’s best, do one’s
utmost, make every effort’. In other words, in a position where one can
show one’s character, one’s mettle.
The words mettle and metal were used indiscriminately in spelling and
meaning in early editions of Shakespeare’s plays. The common core of
sense is that metal (or mettle) refers to the steel of the sword blade: mettle
(or metal) refers to its temper. A tempered character is as strong as
tempered steeL Today, mettle is an antique exhibit only on display in to
be on one’s mettle; metal is very common, but only with the narrower
sense of iron, copper, etc.

the Blue Riband of the Atlantic: The Blue Ribbon usually forms part of a
larger phrase, such as the Blue Ribbon o f the Turf. In the Blue Ribbon o f
the Atlantic only, it has an alternative form, the Blue Riband o f the Atlan­
tic. This became popular in the first half of this century when great liners
such as the Queen Mary and the United States vied with each other to be
quickest across the Atlantic. With the decline of the great passenger ships
of those earlier years, not surprisingly the expression itself is rarely heard
and used today. There is no difference in meaning or connotation between
ribbon and riband in the phrase.
Lurch and mettle are like loggerheads and scot-free (and still others in
this dictionary): they are only used in common idioms. Riband is rather
different, in that the very idiom in which it finds its unique use is now
dying out.
Alliteration
We are very fond in English of alliterative expressions, that is, words
which repeat the same letter. Spick and span is one example in this book.
There are plenty more like that, where antiques are left over from a
previous generation.
might and main: With might and main or by might and main are the usual
forms. The word main is a synonym of might, with the sense of ‘strength
and force’. It is preserved only in this fixed phrase, thanks to the power
of alliteration.
rack and ruin: Similarly with this expression. Ruin we use today, rack we
don’t. It comes in fact from the word wreck - of a ship, for example.
Again, it is a synonym of the other word in its doublet. So for emphasis
and added effect we have rack and ruin, with the current idiomatic phrase
containing an old word unused elsewhere.
kith and kin: Here the phrase is probably more frequent than either noun
in it taken individually, although kin still has some currency in its own
right. Kith means one’s friends and neighbours, rather than one’s blood
relations, one’s kin. Interestingly, the contemporary meaning of kith and
kin has narrowed to mean only one’s relatives. John Galsworthy was using
it in this way in 1920 when In Chancery was published: Its depleted bins
preserved the record o f family festivity: all the marriages, births, deaths o f
his kith and kin.

110

The Old Curiosity Shop of Linguistics continued
In the cases above and some below, the idioms owe their preservation to
alliteration. In several of the following instances, rhyme and emphasis
preserve little-used words in fixed phrases:
chop and change
part and parcel
scot and lot
neck or nothing
hither and thither
beck and call
hammer and tongs
hole and corner
sackcloth and ashes

humming and hawing
by hook or by crook
jot or tittle
ever and anon
to and fro
cut and run
hard and fast
hue and cry
stuff and nonsense

Preserving old meanings
So far the examples have been of words that are used mainly or exclusively
in idioms. The two instances that follow are words very commonly
employed on their own. However, in certain idioms they preserve an old
sense that has been lost in wider usage.
mind: The word mind, for instance, used to mean ‘memory’, so when we
say to keep in mind or to call to mind, we are saying we are ‘keeping it in
memory, we are calling it to our memory’. And time out o f mind means
‘so long ago that no one can remember it’.
Mind didn’t only mean ‘memory’, it also meant ‘intention’ or ‘purpose’,
so when we use the phrases to know one’s own mind, or to change one’s
mind, to be in two minds, to have a mind to do something, we are referring
to this earlier meaning.
pain: Similarly, the word pain. Today it means ‘physical suffering’, such
as the hurt you experience when you cut yourself with a knife, but it does
have earlier senses. For instance, it meant ‘punishment’. So when we use
the phrases under pain o f death or on pain o f death, we are actually saying
‘on the punishment of death’.
Pain had a second sense in earlier years of ‘trouble’ or ‘effort’. So
the expressions to take great pains to do something, or to be at pains
to do something or for one’s pains, all refer to the trouble or effort
that it costs us.

The hook is thought to be a bill-hook and
the crook a shepherd’s crook. A law from
feudal times permitted the poor to gather
firewood from nearby forests, but in
order to prevent the indiscriminate felling
and lopping of trees and branches, peas­
ants were only allowed to take dead wood
and what they could cut using their hooks
and crooks. The Bodmin Register for
1525 says that ‘Dynmure Wood was open
to the inhabitants o f Bodmin . . . to bear
away upon their backs a burden o f lop,
hook, crook, and bag wood.’

C H A T , October 1991.

ice: to break the ice____________
to break down social awkwardness and
formality
This idiom is at least five hundred years
old. It is not unique to English, but is
found in other European languages also.
The allusion is thought to be to the hard
ice that formed on European rivers in
severe winters centuries ago. In years
gone by it was indeed possible to skate
on the Thames. But ice was not enjoyed
by those whose livelihood depended on
plying a small boat up and down the river.
Their first task was that of breaking it up
so that work could begin.
Originally the expression was used to
mean just that, making a start on a pro­
ject. Gradually it came to mean
embarking upon a relationship and
breaking down the natural reserve one
feels in the presence of strangers.
On things that are tender and unpleasing,
it is good to break the ice, by some whose
words are o f less weight, and to reserve
the more weighty voice, to come in, as by
chance.

Someone with other irons in the fire has a

fire he has too many plans and cannot pay
sufficient attention to any of them.
Some authorities say the phrase is from
the smithy where the efficient blacksmith
has several irons in the fire ready for
when he needs them. Others say it alludes
to the industrious laundress who would
keep two or three flat irons heating in
the fire for when the one she was using
cooled. If she had too many irons in the
fire she might find that some had become
too hot and scorched the clothes instead
of smoothing them. The second of the

Janus-faced___________________

a sheltered existence away from the prob­
lems and realities of life

hypocritical

The French romantic poet, playwright
and novelist Alfred de Vigny led a life
of disappointment and frustration. In his
later years he withdrew from society and
became very solitary, although he con­
tinued to write. In a poem, Pensees
d ’A o u t (1837), the critic Sainte-Beuve
called Vigny’s isolated existence his tour
d ’ivoire (ivory tower).
The phrase is regularly used of aca­
demics who have a reputation of living in
a world separate from the harsh realities
of life.

Janus was a Roman deity and guardian of
the gate of heaven (hence, god of gates
and doors). Having two faces, he was able
to look ahead and behind at the same
time. People who are hypocritical have
long been described as having two faces.
In his Sermons (1550), Thomas Lever
writes: 'These flatterers be wonders peril­
ous fellowes, hauynge two faces under one
hoode.’ It is easy to see how the deity
depicted with two faces came to be linked
with the idea of hypocrisy.
See two-faced.
Labour had a ‘Janus-faced attitude’ and
there was no scope fo r even a ‘fraction o f
Labour’s reckless spending promises’.

There is no denying his ability to turn a
moribund establishment upside down,
inflicting the demands o f commerce upon
the inhabitants o f an ivory tower.

income whilst maintaining a show of
material affluence in keeping with the

keep something!someone at bay

•

115

usage: familiar

keep something/someone at bay,
to____________________________
to keep someone/something out or at a
safe distance
One source finds the origin of the term in
the significance the ancients attached to
the bay tree, which has been perceived
over millennia as warding off harm or
keeping it at bay. The Romans and
Greeks singled this plant out for its pro­
tective qualities. Noting that lightning
never seemed to strike the bay laurel, the
ancients took to wearing its leaves on
their heads during thunderstorms. Some
of the Roman emperors wore wreaths of
bay as a protective charm. In later cen­
turies bay trees were planted near houses
to offer the household their protection.
The same source claims that the hys­
terical population of London turned to
the bay laurel when the Great Plague
swept through the city in 1665. It is cer­
tainly true that herbs were relied upon for
remedy by the desperate populace. In A
Compendyous Regyment (1567) Borde
recommends herbs to disinfect the air
should a plague strike: ‘. . . in such infeccyous tyme it is good fo r every man . . .
to use dayly, specyally in ye mornyng and
evenyng to burne Juneper, or Rosemary,
or Baye leves, or Majerome or frankensence. ’ But other herbs are also thought to
be efficacious and there is no real evi­
dence to suppose that the bay was looked
upon as being especially so. It is unlikely,
then, that this is the origin of the
expression to keep at bay.
A totally supportable alternative is that
the phrase is connected to an Old French
word abai, meaning ‘barking of hounds in

a pack’. The English word ‘baying’, as of
hunting hounds, shares this root. There
are a number of Old French idioms con­
nected with stag hunting which come
from this same source, for example rendre
les abois and etre aux abois. They are used
when a hunted stag tires in the chase and
turns to face the pursuing hounds. At this
point the stag is both at bay itself and
also holds the dogs at bay - precisely the
senses of the English phrase.
The English expression has had several
conventional forms under the influence of
translations from the French: at abay, at
a bay and today at bay.

kettle of fish, a________________
a mess, a problem, a predicament;
another matter
Some authorities agree that ‘kettle’ is a
corruption of ‘kiddle’, a type of grille put
across a stream to catch fish, but differ in
their subsequent accounts. One suggests
that poachers damaged them while help­
ing themselves to the catch. When the
keeper returned to empty the kiddle, he
might describe rather ruefully the
resulting mess as a pretty or fine kettle o f
fish. Alternatively, but still ironically,
when the kiddle had been in place for
some time it would have collected not
only fish but also weed and assorted
debris from the river - in other words, a
collection of rubbish or a pretty kettle o f
fish.
But most etymologists agree that the
source lies in a type of picnic. A common
arrangement for an outing or social
get-together amongst the gentry in the
Scottish border country was to arrange a
feast on the banks of a river. The main
course would be salmon, straight from the
river and cooked outdoors in a ‘kettle’.
Outings of this kind were known as a
kettle o f fish. Quite how the expression
came to mean a mess or confusion is a
matter for speculation; anything that
could have gone wrong with such an
entertainment has been suggested, from
spilling the kettle to being unable to catch
or land the fish.
My God, this is a pretty kettle offish. For
goodness’ sake, explain yourself, Charlie.

Intensifying the force of one’s word is
a very common device of language.
‘It’s nonsense’ becomes ‘It’s absolute/
complete/perfect/proper/pure/sheer/
thorough/total/utter nonsense.’ It is a
characteristic that works with idioms,
too, especially where the word blue is
involved:
To the old between the devil and the
deep sea we add the adjective blue,
to produce the emphatic between
the devil and the deep blue sea.
You can get away with murder or,
if you do something absolutely out­

scream louder even than if you were

murder is to drive ridiculously fast.

usage: There are two distinct senses: a
fine, pretty, nice kettle o f fish means ‘a

Both are colloquial, and the first is often
ironical.

kick the bucket, to__________ __
to die
Three grim etymologies are suggested for
this expression.
The first concerns the slaughter of pigs.
Once killed, the animals would be sus­
pended by the back legs from a wooden
frame known as a bucket. Any muscular
twitch or spasm after death caused the
pig to kick against the bucket. Another
common country practice was to suspend
a living pig from a beam by its heels and
cut its throat. The blood from the strug­
gling animal then drained into a strategi­
cally placed basin beneath.
Opinions vary as to how the bucket got
its quaint name. One view is that it comes
from the Old French word buquet, mean­
ing ‘balance’, which suggests that the

The absurd
There is a whimsical and absurd side to many people. It finds its reflection
in the writings of Lewis Carroll and Ogden Nash, amongst many others.
Children (and the child in all of us) seem especially to enjoy the super­
ficially senseless:
Hey diddle diddle, the cat and the fiddle,
the cow jumped over the moon.
The little dog laughed to see such sport
and the dish ran away with the spoon.
This is one of the best known nursery rhymes in the English language. Its
appeal and popularity stem largely from the fact that it doesn’t make very
much sense at all. In general, we like the illogical and we enjoy the
humour of the ridiculous. Indeed the nursery rhyme tells us that the little
boy laughed at the absurdity and fun of the cow jumping over the moon.
This is exactly what Sir Henry Reed meant when, in discussing the origin
of the rhyme, he rather neatly commented:
I prefer to think that it commemorates the athletic lunacy to which the
strange conspiracy o f the cat and the fiddle incited the cow.
There are a good number of instances of obvious illogic. The colloquial
you can*t have your cake and eat it would make so much better sense if it
were commonly said you can’t eat your cake and have it. An American
novel first published in 1950 was entitled Have your cake and eat it, but
few are so precise. Idioms in general can appear totally illogical, because
there is this gap (as What is an idiom?, page 6, tries to show) between
the literal meaning of the individual words and the meaning of the
idiomatic whole. It is unclear at first sight why to knock spots off
someone as separate words (‘to remove dots of colour’) should have any
logical connection with to knock spots off someone (‘to defeat someone
easily’). Readers of this dictionary and professional etymologists might
know the connection (though the logical nature of the link is often
obscure), but it is unknown and apparently nonsensical to the great
majority. That, international experts agree, is part of the appeal of the
idiom. Guiraud put it, about French idioms, that ‘oddity, nonsense
indeed, are a source o f success and survival for many idioms'. An English
expert, Smith, summarises the attraction beautifully:
There is a certain irrelevance in the human mind, a certain love for the
illogical and absurd, a reluctance to submit itself to reason, which breaks
loose now and then and finds expression for itself in idiomatic speech.

bucket was a beam rather than a frame.
Another theory is that the carcase was
first bound to a wooden block before
being hoisted on to the frame by means
of a pulley. This action brought to mind
the drawing of water from a well and so
the block, and not the frame, was called
a bucket.
Suicide is suggested for the second ety­
mology. An article by De Quincy in the
London Magazine of 1823 talks of a tra­
dition among the ‘slang fraternity’ that

Kingdom: till/to Kingdom come
forever; to death
‘H e’s gone to Kingdom come, he’s dead’
is the rather blunt way the expression is
defined in G rose’s Dictionary o f the Vul­
gar Tongue (1785). It refers to the next
life when every man will have to give
account of himself before God. The
words themselves may come from the
Lord’s Prayer as recorded in Matthew
6:10. The phrase was obviously much
used in the spoken language long before
it was considered suitable for the written
word. The first reference in writing was
in Peter Pindar’s Subjects fo r Painters
(1789):
A n d forty pounds be theirs, a pretty
sum, For sending such a rogue to
Kingdom-come.
Used with the conjunction until/till, the
sense is rather different. The idea here is
that the Second Coming of the Bible,
when the Kingdom will be installed here
on earth, is a very long way off - so long
that the action can be continued almost
forever, with impunity.

knock into a cocked hat, to

usage: informal

to beat roundly, to show someone/some­
thing to be inferior to the opposition

lap: it is in the iap of the gods
There are several theories about this
American phrase. One of them claims
that it refers to the three-cornered, or
tricorne, hats worn by army field officers
in the eighteenth and early nineteenth
centuries. Apparently much fun was
made of them because of their strange
shape and their brims which curled up on
three sides. So knocked into a cocked hat
became synonymous with ‘pushed out of
shape’, ‘good for nothing’.
An alternative theory concerning hats
suggests that the cocked hat of the eigh­
teenth century was simply the Puritan
headgear of the 1600s with the brim
‘cocked’, or turned up, on three sides,
giving a triangular shape. To knock into
a cocked hat, therefore, meant to make
dramatic changes to something, and from
there to defeat roundly.
A final suggestion is that the expression
alludes to an American skittle game
where only three pins were set up, like
the three corners of a cocked hat, as the
points of a triangle. This would seem to
be a much more plausible explanation;
however, Funk (1950) points out that the
first use of the expression in print was in
1833, but that there is no mention of the
bowling game before 1858.

the unknown outcome will be revealed

One very obvious suggestion that has
been made about this idiom is the prac­
tice, common in many cultures since
ancient times, of placing gifts on the
knees of statues depicting seated gods in
the hope that, in return, a prayer would
be answered.
Most authorities agree, however, that
the phrase originated in Homer’s Iliad.
Patroclos, friend of Achilles, had been
killed and the Trojans, having first
stripped his corpse, were intending to
sever the head and march with it through
the city to help them gain the upper hand
in the battle. It was at this point that
Automedon, aware that the outcome was
in the balance, said, ‘These things lie on
the knees o f the gods.' In fact, the impend­
ing humiliation brought the sulking
Achilles back into the battle and led to
the rout of the Trojans and the death of
Hector. The gods, it seemed, were on the
side of Achilles. As for why he was invin­
cible, look up Achilles’ heel.
The future may not be as unalterably
determined by the past as we used to think;
in part at least it may rest on the knees o f
whatever gods there be.

leaf: to turn over a new leaf
to begin again, to resolve to behave better
The need to turn over a new leaf or
embark upon a programme of selfimprovement and character-building
occurs to everyone at one time or
another. New leaves here have nothing to
do with budding leaves on trees but rather
the leaves of a book. The expression orig­
inated in the first half of the sixteenth cen­
tury and it has been suggested that the
book might therefore be one of precepts
to be learnt and mastered for self­
edification. This fits with the improving
tone of the expression but does not satisfy
the present-day notion of making a totally
new beginning. The image is more likely
to be that of turning over a page of blots
and crossed out words and beginning
again on clean, white paper.

‘Now I am about to take m y last voyage,
a great leap in the dark. ’ These are said to
have been the words with which English
philosopher, Thomas Hobbes (15881679), quit this world. It was not long
before Hobbes’ striking words were being
borrowed by others. In 1697, just eigh­
teen years after Hobbes’ death, Sir John
Vanbrugh published his play The Pro­
vok’d Wife in which one of the characters
exclaims, ‘Now I am fo r H ob’s voyage a great leap in the dark. ’
Defoe, Byron and Disraeli are amongst
those who have quoted Hobbes when
writing about death. Over the years, how­
ever, the original reference of the words
has been forgotten and the term is now
loosely applied to any venture whose out­
come is full of uncertainty.

leg

•

leg: to pull someone’s leg
to make someone the target of a goodhumoured joke or deception
A Scottish rhyme using ‘draw’ rather than
‘pull’ shows us the expression’s country
of origin:
He preached, an’ at last drew the auld
body’s leg,
Sae the kirk got the gatherins o ’ our Aunty
Meg.
(Alexander Anderson, Rhymes, 1867)
Aunty Meg, it seems, was the subject of
a certain amount of trickery and decep­
tion, a sense which American usage of the
idiom retains but which has been weak­
ened to mean a bit of good-humoured,
harmless fun in English.
There is speculation as to why the leg
needed to be pulled. It is difficult to make
the connection between the sense of the
expression and the macabre suggestion
that it refers to the right of a criminal
sentenced to hanging to have his relatives
pull on his legs, so hastening his death.
More likely is the proposal that pulling a
person’s leg meant pulling it from under
him, so tripping him up in public and
making him a subject of ridicule.
It even occurred to me that he had been
pulling my leg, and that the conversation
had been an elaborate and humorous dis­
guise fo r his real purpose.

lick into shape, to
to give form to something, to make some­
thing or someone presentable
The ancients believed that bears gave
birth to nothing more than formless
lumps of flesh which they then literally
licked into cub-shape. Pliny the Elder
describes this in his Naturalis Historia
(AD 77) and Plutarch takes up the theme
in Moralia: On Affection fo r Offspring
(cAD 95). This ancient belief seems to
have prevailed until at least the mid
sixteenth century, for Rabelais writes
about it in Pantagruel (1545).
The belief took on a figurative dimen­
sion quite early. Around AD 150 Aulus
Gellius described how Virgil, close to
death, begged his friends to destroy the
Aeneid because he had not had time to
perfect it:
For he said that as the bear brought forth
her young formless and misshapen, and
afterwards by licking gave it form and
shape, just so the fresh products o f his
mind were rude in form , but afterwards
by working over them he gave them
definite form and expression (Noctes
Atticae).
Which is the exact meaning of our
modern idiom: putting something in
order and making it presentable, or get­
ting someone to behave or work as
expected.

limelight, in the
in the public eye, the centre of public
attention
When calcium oxide, or lime, is heated it
gives off a glaring white light. Thomas
Drummond, a British army engineer,
used this discovery to help his mapmaking in dismal weather conditions. The
very visible limelight (the Drummond
light of 1826) was used as a marker for
measuring distances accurately. Scientists
took up this invention, adapting it to pro­
duce powerful lights that were then used
in film-projection, lighthouses and later
in the theatre, rather like spotlights, to
draw attention to the principal artiste on
the stage. Someone standing in the lime­
light was very much the focus of public
attention. So powerful was the light that
there were cases of people going blind
through too great exposure to it.
To steal the limelight suggests deliber­
ately seizing the public attention, to the
detriment usually of a rival, as may be the
case in one of the quotations.
‘It’s difficult to grow up in the limelight
and come out your own person, people
don’t allow you to. ’

lion’s den: to enter the lion’s den
to undergo an extreme test, to face over­
whelming opposition
The lion is legendary for ferocity and
bravery, so to enter its very lair is a most
challenging test, requiring the same vir­
tues in even greater measure.
The modern use implies choice and
willingness to take on the daunting task.
This contrasts with the practice of the
ancient world where being thrown to the
lions was a mode of carrying out the death
sentence. This is exactly the case in the
incident that popularised the phrase. In
the Old Testament story, political plot­
ters trapped King Darius into throwing
one of his three senior ministers, Daniel,
to the lions for praying publicly to his
God. Because he had signed an irrevo­
cable law (a law of the Medes and Per­
sians - the origin of that phrase), Darius
had to carry out the prescribed pun­
ishment:
So at last the king gave the order fo r
Daniel’s arrest, and he was taken to the
den o f lions. The king said to him, *.M ay

over them, a second share is his due

long in the tooth
old
Authorities are divided as to whether the
teeth in question are human or equine.
Advertisements claim that more teeth are
lost through gum disease than through
decay. Diseased gumsrecede over the years
and this makes teeth look longer. Our
ancestors had none of the benefits of
modern dentistry and a mouthful of ‘long
teeth’meant that the wearer of the smile was
past the first flush of youth. The French
playwright Moliere was well aware of the
problem. In Le Medicin Malgre L ui (1666)
he writes: ‘The teeth have time to grow long
while we waitfo r the death o f someone.'

loose end, at a
having nothing in particular to do
There are two suggested etymologies.
The first is that the expression goes back
to the time of sailing ships when the vast
number of ropes on the rigging needed to
be kept in good order. The ends of the
ropes were tightly bound to prevent them
unravelling. When there was little else to
do on board ship, the captain would order
the crew to check them and bind any
loose ends to keep his men occupied.
Alternatively the phrase may refer to
an untethered working horse turned out
into its field at the end of the day to kick
up its heels.
Although John Heywood in his
Proverbs (1546) writes that ‘some loose
or od ende will come man, some one daie'
it may not be our modern phrase which
is intended, for the expression is not
picked up again until the mid nineteenth
century.

make (both) ends meet, to______
to live within one’s means
People have been lamenting their
inability to make both ends meet and live
within their income since the seventeenth
century, though some people are content
with just enough to satisfy their needs.
Thomas Fuller, writing in 1662, describes
the saintly Cumberland thus: ‘Worldly
wealth he cared not fo r, desiring onely to
make both ends meet\ (Worthies,
‘Cumberland’).
In all probability the expression comes
from accountancy. Meet as an adjective
meant ‘equal’ or ‘balanced’, so the
accounting practice of balancing profits
and losses was described as making both
ends meet. Also, ends refers to ends of the
accounting year - hence the fuller version
used by Smollett: ‘He made shift to make
the two ends o f the year meet’ (Roderick
Random , 1748).
This story, set in the 1920s, is about two
sisters coping with life after father and

McCoy: the real McCoy
the authentic, genuine article; the real
thing
There are various possibilities for the
derivation of this phrase, from both sides
of the Atlantic.
Many authorities subscribe to the
theory that it refers to Kid McCoy, an
American boxer famous early this


    evince -p 134 /media/bluelegend/Verbatim/Empire/Doks/Lang/en-idiomdict2.pdf &

•

century. On one occasion he was being
provoked by a drunk who would not
accept that this was really the lightweight
champion. Eventually the boxer, goaded
beyond endurance, punched the drunk
and knocked him out. The man’s first
words as he came to were, ‘Y ou’re the real
M cC oy'
A second American, Bill McCoy, may
be another source. This infamous
smuggler in the Prohibition period
brought in hard liquor down the Atlantic
coast of America from Canada. Hence,
anything described as ‘the real McCoy’
was the genuine article, not a home­
brewed or distilled substitute.
Scotland provides two slightly earlier
derivations. In the late 1800s a man
named Mackay advertised his particular
brand of whisky as ‘the real Mackay’, to
distinguish it from another product of the
same name. Yet another story tells of
family feuds. There were two branches of
the MacKay clan in dispute over which
was the senior. Eventually it was estab­
lished that the MacKays of Reay, the
Reay MacKays, held this honour.
The evidence points to a British origin.
Then the phrase spread far and wide:
there is a mention of it in an Irish ballad
of the 1880s and it was recorded in Aus­
tralia in 1903. It would surely have
reached the New World also, where one
or both of the colourful McCoys at least
influenced the spelling of the phrase.
Is this a remake, or the original
colourised, or a ‘restored’ version inflated
with newly found footage that Orson
Welles never wished included? Fear not;
this Citizen Kane is the real McCoy,
released on the occasion o f its fiftieth anni­

middle of the road_____________
a position midway between two extremes,

The middle of the road is a dangerous
place for pedestrians. It is strange, there­
fore, that this position should have
become synonymous with safety, with
steering a middle course uninfluenced by
extremes. It has been suggested that the
phrase originated in times when there
were no pavements and gutters ran with
all sorts of foul rubbish and effluent, so
that the middle of the road was a cleaner
and easier place to walk than the edge. It
was also a safer place. There was little
traffic and a pedestrian ran less risk of
being run over by a horse-drawn vehicle
than of being dragged into some dark
alleyway and robbed. The suggestion is
just about plausible. There is, however,
no evidence to support it.

mind one’s p’s and q’s, to______
to take great care how one speaks and
behaves
Speculation abounds on the origin of this
phrase, which has been with us since the
beginning of the seventeenth century.
One explanation is that the expression
used to be ‘mind your toupees and your
queues’, the ‘toupee’ being false hair and
the ‘queue’ being the pigtail popular in
days gone by. A popular riddle connected
these hairstyles to the alphabet:
Who is the best person to keep the alphabet
in order? Answer - A barber, because he
ties up the queue, and puts toupees in
irons.

Hairpieces are never very secure and
would certainly prohibit the wearer from
anything but the most decorous
behaviour.
A nother suggestion is that it comes
from the dancing school where wigs
remained a problem. Students were con­
stantly being reminded to perfect their
‘pieds’ (footwork) and to have care for
their ‘queues’ (wigs).
Alternatively the phrase may have
arisen from the old custom in alehouses
of hanging a slate behind the door on
which ‘p’ or ‘q ’ (pint or quart) was written
against the name of each customer
according to how much he had drunk.
The accounts would be settled on payday.
The landlord had to keep a careful record
of his p ’s and q’s and the customer had to
ensure that only the ale he had consumed
was marked up.
There are also stories arising from the
similarity of ‘p’ and ‘q’. Children often
have difficulty in distinguishing between
these two letters. ‘Mind your p ’s and q ’s ’
must have been on the lips of governesses
and tutors throughout the land. A final
thought in this regard is that typesetters
had problems in keeping their p’s and q’s
from getting mixed up.
He had not penetrated into the upper dom ­
estic strata o f Bursley society. He had
never been invited to any house where, as

Someone who is over the moon is elated.
This phrase was frequently used in the
1970s by footballers and their managers
to express their delight at victory. This
overuse was seized upon by the satirical
magazine Private E ye, which proceeded
to ridicule televised post-match inter­
views with the result that both over the
moon and its counterpart sick as a parrot
have become football cliches.
The allusion to feeling so high with
excitement that one imagines one could
jump or fly over the moon is easily under­
stood - see Moonshine (page 130). A
definite origin for the phrase is obscure.
Rees (1990) mentions that the family of
William Gladstone’s wife invented idio­
matic phrases which they used in private
and over the moon is said, by some, to be
one of these. Perhaps she was inspired
by the well-known nursery rhyme ‘Hey

moot point, a_________________
an issue which is open to various
interpretations or viewpoints but to which
no satisfactory answer is ever found
The word ‘moot’ can be traced back to
the old Anglo-Saxon words mot and
gemot, meaning ‘meeting’. The political
structure of Saxon society took the form
of different assemblies where public mat­
ters could be debated; the wardmote was
a ward meeting, the burgmote a town
meeting and the witenagemote a meeting
of prominent wise men.
The sixteenth century saw the estab­
lishment of mootings, or moot courts at
the Inns of Court in London. Here young
law students were given the opportunity
to sharpen their powers of argument and
debate by participating in hypothetical
trials. The practice continues today:

Moonshine
For centuries the moon has appeared to man to be distant and remote,
quite untouchable and unreachable. So the moon has come to have the
extended metaphorical sense of the impossible, that which it is futile to
pursue. Shakespeare in Julius Caesar, Act IV, Scene iii (1599) captures
this sense:
I had rather be a dog, and bay the moon,
Than such a Roman.
Since then the sense of being engaged in some fruitless enterprise has
become common in good literary style. C. P. Snow in Strangers and
Brothers (1940) writes:
I have never been in so many troubles. I am baying at the moon. Some­
times the group itself seems like a futile little invention o f my own. I am
thoroughly despondent.
The moon’s inaccessibility is perhaps the very reason it has been passion­
ately desired and sought after. One example of this is to ask for the moon
or, slightly less commonly, to cry for the moon, meaning ‘to want what is
difficult or nearly impossible to obtain’. The suggested origin for the
phrase is children who cry for the moon in order to be able to play with
it. A nice example of its use comes from J. B. Priestley’s Angel Pavement
(1930):
To have a little place o f his own with a garden and a bit o f music
whenever he wanted it, that wasn't asking too much. And yet for all the
firm's increased turnover and its rises, he couldn't help thinking it was
really like asking for the moon.
A related expression is to promise somebody the moon, that is, ‘to promise
somebody so much that it will be impossible to carry it out’. Here is an
example of its use:
Their marriage was never very secure. During their courtship he
promised her the moon and she, being a rather immature and naive girl,
believed him. She soon found out the truth.
A further extension of the same basic meaning comes in to pay or offer
somebody the moon for something. That is, ‘to offer a seemingly imposs­
ibly large amount of money’. The person is so desperate he will go to the


    evince -p 138 /media/bluelegend/Verbatim/Empire/Doks/Lang/en-idiomdict2.pdf &

131

very limit of his resources to get what he wants. In football today, transfer
fees are so high that clubs find they have to pay the moon to get the
players they want.
What could be more romantic than two lovprs hand in hand in the
moonlight? It is a universal scene, depicted in countless paintings and
sung of in numerous popular songs. But things aren’t always so perfect
and idyllic. The hours of darkness can be the perfect cover for illegal
deeds, with the moon providing just enough light to carry out the task,
but not enough to make detection easy. There are strong connotations
here of illegality - a far cry from the sugary sentimentality of romance in
the moonlight.
Moonlighting is an American term, progressively more common in
Britain, which means doing a second job in addition to one’s regular work.
In these days of the thirty-five- or forty-hour working week, many people
are able to take on a second job and indeed many are forced to do so in
order to maintain their standard of living in the face of recession, inflation
and rising prices. There is nothing particularly wrong in that, but moon­
lighting implies that this second job is not declared to the authorities, in
order to avoid paying taxes.
to do a moonlight flit: A clearly illegal activity comes up in this colloquial
phrase. To do a moonlight flit is another instance of using the cover of
darkness and the dim light provided by the moon, this time to disappear
quickly and secretly from where one is living, to avoid paying the bills.
An alternative form of the expression had a certain vogue in the first
half of this century, and it equally concerned the moon. The quotation is
from George Orwell’s Down and Out in Paris and London (1933): I
remember how surprised she was at my asking her instead o f removing the
clothes on the sly, shooting the moon being a common trick in our quarter.
Moonshine is an American term. One sense of it - ‘airy, empty nonsense’
captures the ethereal and ephemeral quality of moonlight. More com­
monly in England, it is taken to mean ‘illegally made liquor’. In the early
years of this century, particularly during Prohibition, there was consider­
able distillation of spirits without the knowledge of the authorities, with
the dim light of the moon as the best cloak for these illegal activities.
Interestingly, there is a related eighteenth-century British use that refers
to the illegality of the distribution of spirits, rather than to its production:
moonshine was brandy smuggled from France to England.

remembered the man he had treated the
previous day and hastened to inform the
police. But in spite of his prompt and
dutiful action, the doctor himself was
arrested and charged with being a con­
spirator. Although innocent, he was con­
victed
and
sentenced
to
life
imprisonment.
In 1869 Dr Mudd was pardoned and
released by President Andrew Johnson
in recognition of his help during an out­
break of yellow fever at the prison, but
public hatred of Booth and anyone con­
nected with him was so intense that Dr
Mudd was never forgiven and his name
came to be used to refer to any scoundrel
or wrongdoer. Later generations suffered
for bearing the name of Mudd and it was
not until the 1970s that Dr Mudd’s inno­
cence was finally declared and the family
name cleared.

mumbo jumbo

nail: to pay on the nail_________

nonsense, something that has no meaning

to make a prompt cash payment

Explorers of the African interior brought
back tales of Mumbo Jumbo. The earliest
is in Francis Moore’s Travel into the
Inland Parts o f Africa (1738): ‘A dreadful
Bugbear to the Women, call'd M umboJumbo, which is what keeps the Women
in awe. ’
Mungo Park, writing about his travels
in the African interior at the end of the
eighteenth century, says that Mumbo
Jumbo was a spirit invented by the men
of the villages to keep their womenfolk in
order. Polygamy was the tribal custom
and bickering and backbiting was
common amongst wives. When life
became intolerable, the husband would
disguise himself as Mumbo Jumbo and
then visit the culprits at night, shrieking
and moaning until they were frightened
into submission. The main troublemaker
was then bound to a tree and whipped.
The word has come into English to
mean a superstitious ritual or gibberish,
from the meaningless rantings of Mumbo
Jumbo’s nocturnal visitations.

In the medieval marketplace honest deal­
ing was encouraged by the setting up of
pillar-like counters known as ‘nails’.
Money was literally placed on the nail in
full public view as bargains were struck.
If proof were needed, four bronze ‘nails’
still stand on the pavement outside the
Exchange in Bristol and there is another
in Limerick, as well as a copper plate at
the Liverpool Stock Exchange.
But the truth is that this old phrase was
in use before the nails were put there and
the market pillars probably took their
name from the expression, not the other
way round. Nor is the term unique to
England; German and Dutch share the
same expression. This is another of the
language’s mysteries - the origin has been
lost in time.

namby-pamby_________________
sentimental and insipid
Namby pam by was a nickname for
Ambrose Philips, who penned dainty pas­
toral verse in the first half of the eigh­
teenth century. Pope, who had written
some poems in a similar vein, was a harsh
critic of Philips’ verse, maintaining that
his own was far superior, so that literary
society of the day was divided in its allegi­
ance. When Philips produced a poem
written for the infant daughter of Lord
Carteret which was especially cloying in
its sentimentality, therefore, its publi­
cation sent dramatist and critic Henry
Carey - a supporter of Pope - scurrying
for his pen. He it was who coined Namby
Pamby, though Pope was swift to join the
attack and make use of the nickname.
Dr Johnson is gentler in his assessment
of Philips’ poetry, however. In his Life o f
Philips, he writes: 'The pieces that please
best are those which, from Pope and
Pope's adherents, procured him the name
o f Namby P am by/
It is an advance: fo r decades, the prevail­
ing official and social attitude was that
therapy was a namby-pamby luxury, and
more than these monsters deserved.

needle: like looking for a needle

a near-impossible search for something
An old alternative for ‘haystack’, which
was current in this expression from the
sixteenth to the eighteenth centuries, was
‘bottle of hay’. ‘Bottle’ was an old word

for a bundle of hay or straw, from the Old
French botel, a diminutive form of botte,
meaning ‘a bundle’. The expression is
very evocative of the total impossibility
of a search - the thin needle in amongst
the long slim stalks of the haystack or
bundle.

Until the advent of factory farming, a

nest: to feather one’s (own) nest
to provide, probably by dishonest means,
for one’s future financial security
The allusion is to those breeds of bird
who, having made their nests, line them
with the softest feathers, plucked from
their own breasts or found on the ground,
to provide comfort for themselves while
incubating their eggs and later for their
young. The phrase is often used in a criti­
cal tone to suggest that those who are
feathering their nests are doing so dis­
honestly. John Bunyan used it in this
sense in Pilgrim’s Progress (1680): ‘Mr
Badman had well feathered his Nest with
other m en’s goods and m oney.’
Neither party had any strong basis o f sup­
port in the country, which tended to dis­
trust them both, the Tories because they
were supposed to oppose all change and
the Whigs because they were popularly
suspected o f using office to feather their
own nests.

nettle: to grasp the nettle_______
to face a problem with determination
The nettle, which causes so much dis­
comfort when lightly touched, has been
used for centuries for its medicinal and
nutritious properties. In one of his poems
(1745), John Gay advises ‘Nettle’s tender
shoots, to cleanse the blood’ and John
Wesley in his Primitive Physick (1747)
urges ‘Take an ounce o f nettle juice’. But
how did intrepid cottagers gather this
stinging plant? Aaron Hill’s poem, The
Nettle’s Lesson (1743), tells the secret:
Tender-handed stroke a nettle,
A n d it stings you fo r your pains;
Grasp it like a man o f mettle,
A n d it soft as silk remains.

* nick o f tim e*

Through the centuries, idioms have
nearly always been looked down on.
In the eighteenth century, Addison
warned against their use in poetry and
in the seventeenth Dr Johnson had
laboured in his dictionary ‘to refine
our language to grammatical purity
and to clear it from colloquial barbar­
isms, licentious idioms and irregular
combinations’. There is not much
charity for the humble idiom there.
Many writers, Henry James for
instance, have tried to steer clear of
them. Students in a 1960s textbook
were warned against even slightly col­
loquial idioms as ‘phrases which
should not be used in the drawing
room’.

of the tally it is not surprising that refer­
ence to it should enter popular parlance.
To nick it dow n, for instance, meant ‘to
record something’ and to nick the nick ‘to
hit the right time’ for something.
In the nick o f time is the only extant
expression. It probably has sporting
origins. Team scores were notched up on
nick-sticks and when a winning point or
goal was scored just before the end of the
contest it was ‘in the nick of time’.
The patient’s hand suddenly swooped
down on the sterile field and was grabbed
in the nick o f time. ‘D on’t they restrain the
patients here?’ I asked. No, they did not.

nine days’ wonder, a___________
something which arouses great interest
that quickly fades
A fourteenth-century author, possibly
Chaucer, reminds us that ‘A wonder last
but nyne night never in toune.’ What this
wonder is, however, is open to specu­
lation. One theory is that the phrase orig­
inates from the Catholic ‘Novena’,
festivals of nine days’ duration, in which
the statue of the saint being honoured is
carried through the streets, accompanied
by relics and votive offerings. According
to Hargrave, the Latin root is novenus,
‘nine each’, which not uncommonly was
confused with novus, ‘new, wonderful’,
thus perhaps reinforcing the wonder
element of the English phrase. A more
down-to-earth interpretation is that the
festival focuses attention for nine days but
is soon forgotten in the anticipation of
and preparation for the next.

nip something in the bud, to
to prevent a problem growing by deal­
ing with it at an early stage
Good gardeners are not afraid of pinch­
ing out new shoots or buds before they
develop fully in order to encourage
sturdier growth on the main stems and a
better show of fruit or flowers. The
emphasis of the idiom is not so much on
early excision of a healthy shoot in
order to develop better growth later,
but on stopping an unhealthy develop­
ment in its initial stages.
From at least the fifteenth-century
anyone abandoned to his difficulties was
said to be left in the briers, a brier being
a thorny bush. Briers, therefore, meant
‘troubles’ or ‘vexations’. A seventeenthcentury proverb speaks of nipping briers
in the bud. James Kelly includes it in
Scottish Proverbs (1721) and Thomas
Fuller records it together with this use­
ful definition: 7 / is good to prevent by
wholesome correction, the vicious incli­
nations o f children.’ Nip the Briar in the
Bud (Gnomologia, 1732). It is better to
deal with a problem in its infancy than
allow it to come into full flower.

A life on the ocean waves
Each kind and area of human activity has its own vocabulary of words,
metaphors and idioms. Sportsmen, musicians, agricultural workers, man­
agers, lawyers, sailors, all have terms peculiar to themselves to describe
their own domain of interest. Some of their expressions find a wider use
in analogous but non-specialist situations: the farmer talks of life in terms
of farming; the sportsman describes business as training, racing and win­
ning; the seaman uses his nautical vocabulary to describe the problems
he meets on land. The most striking or useful of these images and phrases
from the subgroups are often taken up by the majority, and so new fixed
expressions join the standard language. It’s not cricket (page 201) looks
at how one sport has enriched the general language stock of idioms.
Sailors, not surprisingly, have contributed over centuries far more vivid
metaphors and idioms, to what has been traditionally a seafaring nation.
Some of the terms in the following list are clearly nautical metaphors;
others’ maritime origins are genuine but not superficially obvious; still
others may originate elsewhere, though at the very least some authorities
attribute them to naval life.

pervasive. It is a moot point if military or rural life has surpassed it, or
whether The Bible and Shakespeare (see page 180) come near.

There is a less gruesome, though still
messy, alternative. Rhino has been slang
for ‘money’ since the seventeenth cen­
tury. The word is very similar to the
Greek rhinos, meaning ‘nose’, which is
the root of ‘rhinoceros’. The animal is so
called because of the prominent horns on
its nose. The suggestion is that the phrase
connects the idea of being bled for money
with a nosebleed. The fact that the
expression came into written English no
earlier than the end of the seventeenth
century makes this theory the more con­
vincing of the two.

as far back as the first century AD. Pliny
knew the fact and Plutarch wrestles with
the science:
Why does pouring oil on the sea make
it still and calm? Is it because the winds,
slipping over the smooth oil, have no
force, nor cause any waves? (Moralia:
Quaestiones Naturales, cAD 95).
But the phrase might owe its origin to
the Venerable Bede who, in his Ecclesias­
tical History (completed in 731), recounts
a miracle performed by Bishop Aidan. A
priest by the name of U tta was charged
with escorting King Oswy’s bride across
the sea. Before he left he was approached
by the bishop, who gave him a phial of
holy oil. The bishop prophesied that there
would be a fierce storm at sea but
promised U tta that, if he were to cast the
oil upon the water, the storm would
immediately cease and the journey home
would be safe and calm. The storm arose
as Bishop Aidan foretold, the waves
began to fill the vessel and the sailors
were in despair, but Utta remembered
the oil and the sea was calmed.
Strangely, however, the phrase was not
widely used until the nineteenth century,
the suggested explanation for this being
that, until then, oil was not available in
the great quantities needed to still rough
seas.
Today we use the oil of soothing words
or deeds to calm stormy disputes.

Pandora’s box_________________
a seemingly harmless situation fraught
with hidden difficulties
Prometheus offended the gods. In
revenge Jupiter ordered Pandora, the
first woman, to be made. Jupiter gave
Pandora a box which she was to offer to
the man she married. Prometheus was
wary of Pandora, but his brother, Epimethius, married her and, though warned
against it, accepted the box. The moment
he opened it, all the problems and wick­
edness which afflict mankind were loosed
to do their worst and have done so ever
since. All that was left in the bottom of
the box was Hope.
The Eighteenth was a Sceptical Century;
in which little word there is a whole Pan­
dora's Box o f miseries.

parrot: as sick as a parrot______

Originally a Parthian shot, the ex­
pression refers to the war tactics of the
Parthians, an ancient people of south­
west Asia. These skilled mounted archers
would feign retreat, then, twisting round
in their saddles, fire backwards with
deadly accuracy on to the enemy in
pursuit.
Parthian military strategies were
known to Ovid:

extremely disappointed
See over the moon. Rees (1990) provides
two possible explanations for sick as a
parrot. Aphra Benn amongst others in the
seventeenth and eighteenth centuries
used ‘melancholy as a (sick) parrot’. In
the early 1970s several people fell seri­
ously ill with a disease known as psitta­
cosis or parrot fever which was common
amongst cage birds and can be caught by
man. Given the widespread use of the
phrase in sporting contexts, could it be
that it was coined then by an imaginative
footballer called upon to describe his dis­
appointment after losing a vital game?
It was about fifty years too early to be as
sick as a parrot, but Chapman did manage
to communicate his disgust so effectively
that two o f his players never again kicked
a ball fo r the club.

References to Parthian wars are found
throughout seventeenth-century English
literature. A Parthian shot was used in the
nineteenth century and was still in use in
the first quarter of this century until part­
ing shot gained currency. This was
through the similarity in pronunciation
between Parthian and parting, together
with an association of ideas: the Parthian
shot was indeed a parting shot.

This is part of a line from Lycidas (1637),

pecking order, the_____________
the social hierarchy which dictates one’s
relationship to those above and below
one
A strict hierarchy known as the pecking
order operates within the hen coop. The
pecking order is dominated by one par­
ticular hen who has the right to peck all
the others indiscriminately without being
pecked back. The other hens all have
their places below her and know that they
may peck any bird lower in the order but
never one above them. Inevitably there is
one lowly creature who is pecked
viciously by all her sisters but may herself
only peck grain. Similar patterns of domi­
nance exist both in human society as a
whole and within the groups and organis­
ations it divides itself into and, by anal­
ogy, these structures have come to be
known as pecking orders.

There is a pecking order among those
weird young people who smile at you sadly
when your terminal starts playing up, and
then sit down and engage the machine in
a conversation that is way beyond your

as Tom Wolfe called it, and they acknow­

those who have it. There is the girl who
writes ‘elegant code’, that guy who writes
‘beautiful code* and the hot-shot who
writes ‘inspired code’, but who is also ter­

The phrase probably alludes to the slot

then they come to life. Similarly a person
who does not understand a joke or
remark made to him does not react as one
would expect until the penny drops. The

but their popularity increased until there
were more than two hundred models on

food which was starting to go bad. To be
in a pickle came over from Holland in the
sixteenth century. The Dutch version was
in de pekel zitten, ‘to sit in the pickle’,

pig in a poke, a_______________
a purchase that was not properly exam­
ined before it was made
It was the custom in old country fairs to
sell suckling pigs. The trader would have
one pig on show and the rest would be
neatly tied in sacks, or ‘pokes’, ready to
take away. Not all traders were honest,
however, and some would put cats into
the ‘pokes’. The unwary customer would
pay for his pig only to discover the decep­
tion later, but the more wary fellow
would untie his sack to check his pur­

chase. (See to let the cat out o f the bag.)
The phrase is semi-proverbial and
reflects the wisdom of European peoples
over many centuries. The earliest forms
of the phrase throughout Europe speak
only of ‘buying in a sack’, that is of buying
without first inspecting. Later forms warn
against ‘buying a cat in a poke’, and this
is the version that has remained in other
European languages. The pig is an Eng­
lish variation. Although the phrase is an
old one, the accompanying expression to
let the cat out o f the bag is much more
recent and does not appear to have
equivalents in other languages.
Incidentally, the Middle English word
poke is also the root of our present-day
word pocket, meaning ‘little poke’.
I can’t buy a pig in a poke . . . Let me
know what yo u ’ve got to sell, and then
maybe I ’ll make a bid fo r it.

pigeon-hole someone, to
to classify; to put on one side
Our medieval ancestors kept pigeons as
domestic birds, not for racing but for their
meat. Pigeon holes were the openings set
in a wall or a purpose-built dovecote in
which the birds nested. By 1789 the
arrangement of compartments in writing
cabinets and offices used to sort and file
documents had come to be known as
pigeon holes because of their resem­
blance to the pigeon cote. By the mid
nineteenth century pigeon hole was being
used as a verb meaning either to put a
matter to one side with the intention of
coming back to it later, or to classify
information.
How do you behave at fortysomething?
Your lifestyle, children and job will often
dictate much o f what you do. But that’s

yourself into adopting a ‘typically middleaged’ outlook on life.
D A ILY EX PRESS, October 8, 1991.

usage: When people are pigeon-holed,
there is a nuance that the judgement of
them implicit in classification might well
be wrong. It suggests categorising some­
one on a partial or unfair basis. The
hyphen may be omitted.

be pig in the middle. The frustrated ‘pig’
shadows the other players, trying all the
while to catch the ball.
By extension the context of use can
now be rival politicians, factions in an
office, etc. Someone who feels between
the groups, trapped and pressured from
both sides, is piggy in the middle. In the
original game, children might choose to
be the piggy; in the adult version it is not
an enviable situation.

Some authorities believe that the phrase
refers to the pike, a weapon used by the
infantry. The pike was rather like a spear,
but its shaft was so very long that it was
easily visible to all around.
This explanation fits in very neatly with
the modern meaning of ‘extremely obvi­
ous’. However, another theory put for­
ward, and supported by sixteenth-century
references, suggests that the expression
has changed in form and shifted in mean­
ing over the years. Pedlars shouldered a
sturdy staff, known as a packstaff, on to
which they tied their bundle. Constant
use wore the wood plain, and so we find
the comparison plain as a packstaff:
‘Pack-staffe plaine, uttring the thing they
m ent’ (Bishop Joseph Hall, Satires, 1597).
Plain as a pikestaff was a later six­
teenth-century variant.

The comparison with a second kind
of staff refers to the use in the Middle
Ages by those who travelled on foot of a
pikestaff, a stout stick with a metal tip, to
help them along the way. The pikestaff
was a simple, utilitarian affair, and the
simile plain as a pikestaff originally meant
just that, ‘basic, unelaborate’. Thus, in
Charles Cotton’s Scarronides (1664) we
find 'plain as a pike-staff without gilding\
When Trollope writes, ‘The evidence
against him was as plain as a pike-staff ’
(The Last Chronicle o f Barset, 1867), he
means not that the evidence was obvious,
but that it was simple and to the point,
even blunt.

rain cats and dogs, to
to rain heavily
Three theories present themselves for this
picturesque expression.
The most vivid suggests that drainage
in the streets in bygone centuries was so
inadequate that, during storms, stray
dogs and cats drowned in the flood. When
the water level went down, their carcases
littered the streets. Swift’s Description o f
a City Shower (1710) gives us a flavour of
what it was like:
Now from all parts the swelling kennels
flow ,
A nd bear their trophies with them as
they go.
The ‘trophies’ are
amongst them are:

numerous,

but

D rown’d puppies, stinking sprats, all
drench’d in mud,
Dead cats and turnip tops, come tum ­
bling down the flood.
The first written record of the phrase as
we know it comes in Swift’s Polite Con­
versation (1738) and it might be supposed
that he was merely making an allusion to
his earlier verse, which would confirm this
theory and make Swift the author of the
metaphor. Unfortunately the expression
was used in a slightly different form in the
previous century when Richard Brome
wrote: ‘It shall raine . . . dogs and pole­
cats’ ( The City Wit, 1653).

Alternatively, some authorities believe
that the phrase may be a corruption of
the Greek word catadupe, meaning ‘cat­
aract’ or ‘waterfall’. In other words the
original expression had the meaning ‘rain
is coming down like a waterfall’.
Still others suggest a connection with
Norse mythology in which witches in the
guise of cats rode upon storms and the
storm-god Odin was accompanied by a
dog.
There was a danger, when the bumpers

This is a nineteenth-century expression,
but we must look at earlier centuries to
understand its origin.
A herring that has been dried, salted
and smoked turns a reddish colour. These
cured fish have a particularly strong smell
so, in medieval times, they were useful as
a lure for training hounds in stag-hunting.
Later people who were opposed to hunt­
ing, fox-hunting in particular, would drag
a red herring across the fox’s trail and

a day to celebrate
During the fifteenth century it became
customary to mark all feast days and
saints’ days in red on the calendar whilst
other days were in black. These were days
for rejoicing and celebration and so
people began to refer to days which had
particular significance for them person­
ally as red letter days.

red tape______________________
excessive bureaucracy, form-filling
The phrase originates in the former prac­
tice of tying together papers and official
documents with red tape. This procedure
goes back to the seventeenth century, as
instanced by an advertisement in the
Public Intelligencer (December 6, 1658),
which offered a reward for ‘a little bundle
o f papers tied with a red tape which were
lost on Friday la s t. .
Possibly it was
Sydney Smith who first used the term to
satirical effect. Discussing Sir J. Makintosh he writes:

particle o f gall, or the least knowledge
o f the value o f red tape! A s Curran

erned the w orld/
Modern usage has reinforced its use as
a condemnatory phrase, often an insult of
a frustrated man doing battle with offi­
cialdom.

to treat someone harshly, to behave in an

Horses which were roughshod had shoes
from which the nail-heads projected a
little. Practically speaking, this helped to
prevent their feet from slipping on loose
ground or in wet weather, but to be
trampled upon or kicked by a roughshod
horse was no laughing matter.
It has been claimed that the cavalry of
a number of different countries tried to
use their horses as weapons by fitting
them with shoes fashioned with sharp
projecting edges. It was calculated that
the warhorses would damage the steeds in
the enemy ranks. Instead the idea proved
impractical since the horses cut into not
only the adversaries’ mounts but those of
their own company.
They thought they had only a girl to deal
with and that, therefore, they could ride
roughshod over her. But she would show
them their mistake. They wouldn’t have
dared to have treated her like that if she
had been a man.

ring a bell, to_________________
to remind someone of something, to jog
someone’s memory (of a shared
experience)
Speculation abounds as to what kind of
bell rings when the memory is jogged.
Some say that the bell is that which
attracts the attention of a clerk, recep­
tionist or servant and that, in the same
way, something seen or said may sud­
denly focus our attention on a person or
event stored away in our memory.
Another offering says that the bell
could be the one which rings in a shooting
gallery at the fair when a bull’s eye is
scored. This is dismissed by Funk (1955)
who feels the expression would have to
be ‘to ring the bell’ in order to fit in with
this theory. Instead he proposes a bell
which rings a more nostalgic note and
suggests a school or church bell.
What this boils down to is that no one
really knows how the expression came
about.

to do things in as many different ways
as possible for the sake of variation; to

The term comes from bell-ringing. The
seventeenth century saw ‘change ringing’
practised in churches and cathedrals.
‘Changes’ are the different orders in
which bells can be rung. A set of three
bells, for instance, can be rung in a series
of six different changes. The more bells
there are in the belfry, the greater the
number of possible changes. In a bell
tower boasting twelve bells it would be
possible to ring a total of 479,001,600
changes, which would take some thirtyeight years.
Dixon has a nice story about ringing
the changes, although in a different sense:
‘He buys sixpence worth o f currants,
tenders half a crown, and gets back two
shillings as change. Then he says, “Oh,
here is a sixpence; give me back the halfcrown,” which the shopkeeper, taken
unawares, probably does, and the cheat
makes o ff with two shillings. ’
He could apply flattery with so unsparing
a hand that even Princes o f the Church
found it sufficient; and, on occasion, he
could ring the changes o f torture on a
human soul with a tact which called forth
universal approbation.

riot act: to read someone the riot
act___________________________
to quell rowdy or objectionable
behaviour by remonstrating and making
the consequences clear
The A ct fo r Preventing Tumults and Riot­
ous Assemblies, or Riot Act, was decreed
in 1715 in the reign of George I. The act
made it unlawful for twelve or more
people to disturb the public peace
through riotous behaviour. Such a crowd
could be ordered to disperse by a magis­
trate reading aloud the following procla­
mation:
Our Sovereign Lord the King chargeth
and commandeth all persons being
assembled immediately to disperse
themselves, and peaceably to depart to
their habitations or to their lawful
business.
Those who had not obeyed the command
an hour later were sentenced to imprison­
ment with hard labour.
'Y ou’ve never gone short, Joseph. ’
My mother always called me by m y fu ll
name when she wanted to read the riot act.
R O BE R T B R O W N IN G , The Lost Leader, 1845.

What grammatical characteristics do
the following phrases have in
common: to give somebody the boot
and to give it somebody hot and
strong? Each phrase allows the
indirect object to be the subject of a
passive construction: he was given the
boot and he was given it hot and strong
are equally acceptable. It is relatively
unusual for the fixed idiom to show
this degree of flexibility (see what is
an idiom?, page 6).

two apostles: ‘A s one who crucified Paul
that Peter might go free’ (Life o f
St Thomas o f Canterbury).
Usually it is Peter who loses and Paul
who gains; here it is the reverse. Perhaps
the saying is hinting at some old theologi­
cal debate or rivalry within the Christian
church in which the relative merits of the
two apostles were discussed.
Neither is the expression confined to
English. French owns a similar saying descouvrir S Pierre pour couvrir S Pol
(strip St Peter to clothe St Paul) - and so
does German.
The true origin of this centuries-old
expression has been buried in time.

On December 17, 1540 the Church of
St Peter at Westminster became a
cathedral. It enjoyed its elevated status
for only ten years before the privilege
was withdrawn and the diocese of
Westminster fell once again within that
of St Paul’s cathedral. Ill feeling was
further exacerbated when a good portion
of revenue from St Peter’s and was then
used to finance repairs to St Paul’s. They
had robbed Peter to pay Paul.
This story is so convincing that there is
probably an element of truth in it. An
astute mind doubtless applied this apt,
but already current, saying to the contem­
porary cause celebre - for the expression,
in various forms, has in fact been in use
since long before 1540. In 1380 John
Wyclif wrote: ‘Lord, hou schulde God

robbere to Poule in fhe name o f Crist?’;

Memorable events
Out of the welter of events and people we daily experience or hear of, a
very few stick in the memory and are referred to in speech. A tiny pro­
portion of these are so regularly mentioned that they become fixtures in
the language, captured in a particular form of words. Their meaning, too,
may well develop, such that before long the original incident that inspired
them has become a hazy memory and the new sense has taken over. This
is the process through which some idioms are formed. Those discussed
below concern events where the location is preserved in the phrase and
incidents where the protagonist lives on in the expression.
Events and place names
Places sometimes got their names from a historical incident. On December
24, 1777, Captain Cook arrived at an island in the Pacific. We now know
it to be the largest atoll in the world, one of the Line Islands. Not surpris­
ingly, he called his discovery Christmas Island. In similar fashion, idioms
may include a place which refers to an incident that took place there.
Many are of a military character. The famous Greek victory over Troy thanks to a Trojan horse - is universally known. The battle of Waterloo
is probably familiar, too - but what military incidents occurred at the
river Rubicon and at Coventry? See to meet one’s Waterloo, to cross the
Rubicon, to send somebody to Coventry. The sad results of military
exploits in a former colony produced this example:
like the black hole of Calcutta: Surajah Dowlah, Nawab of Bengal, is
generally taken to be the villain of this story, although in all probability
he had no idea of the results of his command. On June 20,1756, following
the seizure of the East India Company’s Fort William, he gave orders for
146 British captives to be incarcerated in the prison there. The miserable
cell measured eighteen feet by four feet ten inches. By morning only
twenty-two men and the one woman prisoner had escaped a horrifying
death by suffocation. This colloquial phrase has often been shortened, as
in this example:
Do you think Miss Pinkerton will come out and order me back to the
black hole? (W. M. Thackeray, Vanity Fair, 1848)
Its continued use is doubtless helped by the black holes that astronomers
have found in outer space over recent years, into which people and


    evince -p 164 /media/bluelegend/Verbatim/Empire/Doks/Lang/en-idiomdict2.pdf &

157

things metaphorically disappear, never to return. It is possible that in
contemporary usage there is a coalescence of the two sources into one
phrase, a black hole.
Sometimes the apparent reference to a famous historical event can be
misleading.
To set the Thames on fire seems to refer to the Great Fire of London. One
can imagine a vivid picture of flaming buildings falling into the Thames and
the lurid reflection of the inferno around making it look as though the
Thames itself were aflame. Alas, Thames is in fact temse, an old word for
a sieve for corn. In the eighteenth century a hard-working farm labourer
might have his leg pulled for going at such a pace that he set his temse on
fire.
Events and people
Some idioms preserve the name of the person concerned in the action 01
incident, rather than the place where it occurred. There are examples
from classical times which are today somewhat literary in use.
a Pyrrhic victory is ‘a hollow victory, won at too high a price’. King
Pyrrhus won the battle at Asculum in 279 BC, yet in the process he lost
all his best officers and many men. ‘One more such victory,’ he said
afterwards, ‘and we are lost.’
to cut the Gordian knot: Gordius, the king of Phrygia, had tied such a
complex knot that no one could untie it. Anyone who did would become
the ruler of Asia. Alexander the Great came across this puzzle in his
conquests and solved it by cutting through the knot with a blow of his
sword. Quick, decisive action, perhaps by unexpected and unorthodox
means, is the sense the phrase has had in English since the days of Shake­
speare:
Turn him to any cause of policy,
The Gordian knot of it he will unloose
(Henry V, Act 1, scene i)
It is by no means necessary to go back always to classical times or look
for a military context. Religion offers at least two examples:
Dr Livingstone, I presume? Dr David Livingstone was a missionary and
explorer in Africa. He had disappeared, so an American journalist, Henry

Morton Stanley, set out to find him. In 1871, he succeeded and uttered
the immortal phrase Dr Livingstone, I presume? Ever since it has been
used for humorous effect on meeting friends and acquaintances, usually
after a long separation or in an unlikely place.
A Catherine wheel: In AD 307, St Catherine of Alexandria had spoken up
on behalf of some persecuted Christians. For her pains the Emperor
Maximus ordered her to be placed on a spiked wheel, tortured and killed.
After a miracle she was ultimately beheaded. To spoil a good story, there
is sufficient doubt of her existence that the Catholic Church withdrew its
official recognition of her in 1969. Her popular fame lives on, however,
in the form of that humble firework, the Catherine wheel.
Peeping Tom is another fictitious character who has become part of the
language. In 1040 Leofric, Earl of Mercia, imposed swingeing taxes upon
the people of Coventry. His wife, Godiva, took the citizens’ part and
pleaded with her husband to cut the amount levied, but he retorted that
she must ride naked through the streets before he would do so. This Lady
Godiva did, and the earl kept his promise.
This well-known tale was expanded in the eighteenth century. The
townsfolk, in accordance with Lady Godiva’s wishes, stayed at home with
their doors and shutters closed tight. But one man, Tom the Tailor, was
so overcome by curiosity that he spied at his lady through a window,
whereupon he was struck blind.
Even though Peeping Tom is a figment of the eighteenth-century imagin­
ation, his fame is such that he appears hourly with Lady Godiva on a clock
set over an archway in Coventry, and he plays a part in an annual procession
that has taken place since 1768 in commemoration of the event.
All the time new phrases are being coined after an incident captures the
public’s imagination. However, very many of them fall out of use in a
decade or two.
to do a Bannister: For a few years after 1954, anyone running fairly fast
might humorously be described as doing a Bannister. This refers to Dr
Roger Bannister’s record of being the first man ever to run a mile in under
four minutes. Today it is more a sporting allusion than an idiom.

to give somebody a Harvey Smith: This phrase of the 1970s will surely
follow the same path and end up being forgotten. But it may perhaps stay
with us in the language for a few years more. After all, Harvey Smith and
his son are still prominent in show-jumping. There is also a linguistic
reason why the phrase might linger on: the natural tendency to use
euphemisms and avoid offensive language. We sometimes say Gosh
instead of God, Heck instead of Hell and the dickens instead of the devil.
So when in August 1971 Harvey Smith raised two fingers in a strong
gesture of contempt at Mr Douglas Bunn, one of the judges of the showjumping competition, the English public saw the incident on TV and were
delighted to use the new phrase to give somebody the old Harvey Smith
in a humorous, euphemistic way.
Some phrases do indeed have a short life, often till the generation that
witnessed the event has itself passed away. Yet others persist. Some thrive
in the spoken language, without the help of the literary form or classical
status that Achilles’ heel, for example, has enjoyed. Bob’s your uncle is
one. A political scandal is suggested for this British quip. In 1886 Prime
Minister Robert Cecil, Lord Salisbury, appointed his nephew, Arthur
Balfour, Chief Secretary for Ireland. Mr Balfour’s abilities were con­
sidered inappropriate for the post and nepotism was suspected. Popular
opinion suggested that he had been selected purely because Bob was his
uncle. In the event, Lord Salisbury’s judgement was vindicated, as Balfour
turned out to be an outstanding politician and ultimately became Prime
Minister himself.
Memorable events are an excellent trigger for the formation of new
idioms, but there is a high drop-out rate. There is no known explanation
why one or two survive whilst the majority fail. In this, idioms reflect the
rest of language. Historical dictionaries are littered with neologisms that
briefly darted across the linguistic firmament like shooting stars, only to
fizzle and fade. Idioms and words alike leave their burnt-out shells as
entries labelled ‘obsolete’ in the great dictionaries of the language.

ropes: to know/learn the ropes

This is a nautical term of nineteenthcentury origin. The rigging on a vast sail­

ropes with which every sailor had to
become familiar because ‘to handle a

nautical context the phrase was then
applied to other areas of expertise.

Caesar, after taking time to reflect on the
consequences of his action, crossed the
Rubicon into the republic with his army,
fully aware that this constituted a declar­
ation of war. (Jacta alea est’ - ‘the die is
cast’ - were the words he is said to have
spoken as he crossed over and began his
successful campaign against Pompey and
the Senate.
It is thought that the Rubicon is the
trickle of water now known as the Fluminico. In 1934 Mussolini ordered a monu­
ment to be put up on its bank, supposedly
at the exact place where Caesar had
crossed.
Compelled to choose between two alterna­
tives, he laid the matter before his wife,
and awaited the verdict from her lips. It
came without hesitation. ‘It is your duty;
the consequences we must leave. Go fo r­
ward, and to victory.’ The die was thus
cast, the Rubicon crossed.

are two theories for its origin, both con­
cerned with types of measurement.

•

In Roman times it was estimated that
the measure of the last part of the thumb
above the top joint would fit roughly
twelve times into the larger measure of a
foot. Thus the foot was split into twelve
‘inches’ (the French called them 4pouces\
meaning ‘thumbs’) and remained a stan­
dard measure for centuries. Careful
measurement required a standard rule
but where an estimated length would do
the thumb sufficed. Now that the metric
system has been adopted, the need to
measure in inches is diminishing and the
practice, if not the phrase, has died out.
An alternative, though not so wellknown, theory is that the temperature of
fermenting ale was checked by dipping
the thumb into the brew. It is said that,
in Yorkshire, such ale was referred to as
‘Thumb Brewed’.

dence to support this theory in Thomas
Nabbes’ Microcosmus (1637): 7 am my
ladies cooke, and king o f the kitchen,
where I rule the roast. ’
O ther authorities suggest, however,
that roast was an alternative spelling for
roost which was originally pronounced
with a long o. Evidence for this comes
from Jewell’s Defence o f the Apologie
which has a spelling confirming the long
medial o in the medieval pronunciation
of roost: ‘Geate you nowe vp into your
pulpites like bragginge cockes on the
rowst, flappe your whinges, and crow out
aloude.’ So the likelihood is that the
origin lies in the comparison with the
cockerel.

No rule so good as rule o f thumb, if it hit.

usage: To give someone the sack, the con­

sackcloth: to wear sackcloth and
ashes_________________________
to be penitent
The phrase alludes to the ancient Hebrew
custom of wearing sackcloth and ashes as
a sign of mourning or penitence. The
sackcloth was black, coarse goathair cloth
which was used to make grain bags. To
wear it was a sign of humility.
The Hebrew word for sackcloth was
saq and the Greek sakkos. The English
word sack is derived from these.

gnashing o f teeth or sackcloth and ashes.

The expression is a biblical one and can
be found in the Sermon on the Mount
(Matthew 5:13) where Jesus says:
Ye are the salt o f the earth: but if the
salt have lost his savour, wherewith
shall it be salted? It is thenceforth good
fo r nothing, but to be cast out, and to
be trodden under fo o t o f men.
The Hebrews found their salt supply in
the Dead Sea and in the Hill of Salt (Jebel
Usdum) nearby. It was rock salt and sub­
ject to chemical changes which meant that
the outer layer, besides being full of
impurities, had very little flavour and was
usually thrown away. This was the salt
that Jesus was referring to in the Sermon.
We no longer accept these country gentle­
men, these opulent ladies who drive about

salt: worth one’s salt___________

salt: to rub salt in the wound

deserving of one’s position or salary

intentionally to increase someone’s pain,
discomfort

Salt has not always been in cheap and
plentiful supply. Salarium (Latin sal,
salt), from which our word ‘salary’
derives, was ‘salt money’, a sum paid to
a Roman soldier so that he could buy salt
and remain healthy. Someone who is
worth his salt is therefore hardworking
and diligent and thoroughly deserves his
salary, privilege or position. The ex­
pression has only been in use since the
nineteenth century, however, when the
phrase was coined from the origins of the
word ‘salary’.

It is a long-standing belief, dating back to
Cicero, Horace and Livy, that wounds
will not heal unless re-opened and
cleaned. The application of salt was one
way of doing this - at a cost of some pain.
Today there is no implication of healing,
just the imposition of discomfort.
It is possible that the phrasal verb to
rub it in is connected.
She sprinkles salt upon m y wound and

to take it with a degree of reservation,

This phrase is held by many to be from
the Latin addito salis grano penned by
Pliny the Elder (cAD 77). He had come
across a story that King Mithridates VI,
King of Pontus, had built up immunity to
poisoning by fasting and swallowing
small, regular doses of poison with a grain
of salt (cum grano salis) to make them
more palatable. Other authorities, how­
ever, take this suggestion with a pinch of
salt, pointing out that Pliny intended the
phrase to be taken literally and that
nowhere in classical Latin does the word

‘salt’ appear as a figurative expression of
scepticism.
Indeed,
the
English
expression would seem to date back no
further than the Middle Ages, giving rise
to speculation that cum grano salis is, in
fact, a piece of medieval Latin. Neverthe­
less, the idiom is easily understood; just
as a sprinkling of salt makes one’s meal
more enjoyable, so a doubtful story or
excuse goes down easier with a pinch of
salt.
John Foxe, the martyrologist, reports that
Cromwell learned the whole o f Erasmus’s
New Testament by heart while travelling
to Rome and back, and although this story
ought to be taken with a pinch o f salt there

with Miles Coverdale when Coverdale was
still a friar at Cambridge.

to their means. The very poor were
exempt from payment and went scot-free.
Tavern scores were known as scots and to
go scot-free meant to be given one’s ale
on the house or to have one’s bill paid
by a drinking companion. There is some

either case it would be welcome!
Tindale used the phrase figuratively in
his Exposition of 1 John 2:2 (1531): *The

in this sense of being allowed to go free
and unpunished that it is still used today.

Powderham Park, Devon where she inad­
vertently crossed .the stag’s scrape and
met with the animal’s fury. Scrapes are
holes which deer habitually dig out with
their forefeet. They can be up to a foot
or eighteen inches in depth so that an
unwary passer-by might easily fall into
one and even injure himself. Anyone
unlucky enough to do so has got him self
into a scrape.

• scratch •

Justice for the Scots!
To go or get off scot-free means that
you get off without payment or with­
out punishment. Why should the
Scots be singled out for such a nega­
tive reputation? The answer is simply
that the scot in the expression has
nothing to do with Scotland, or with
Scotsmen, but is an example of what
is technically known as homonymy.
That is, a word that is spelled and
sounds the same as another one but
has a different meaning. There are
plenty of them in the English lan­
guage, like ‘bank of the river’ and
‘bank you put your money in’, for
instance. Similarly, Scot and scot are
quite different words. The full story
for scot is in the entry.
There is another old phrase which
is not so frequent today, scot and lot.
It occurs quite commonly in Dickens
and other nineteenth-century litera­
ture. Scot means tax, and lot means
something similar. It is connected
with allotment, the allotted portion,
the share you had to pay. So scot and
lot, in fact, were medieval rates. In
recent years householders have paid
rates, poll tax or a community charge,
and council tax for all the services they
receive, such as education, water and
so forth. Centuries ago, they paid scot
and lot, which also qualified them to
vote in elections. But this expression
has fallen into disuse; today we are
left only with the phrase to get off scotfree. It is indeed about medieval taxdodging, but (through homonymy)
the Scots are exonerated from blame!

The deer which . . . were addicted, at cer­
tain seasons, to dig up the land with their
fore feet, in holes to the depth o f . . . half
a yard, contributed a new word to our lan­
guage. These were called ‘scrapes'.
T H E A T H E N A E U M , September 27, 1862.

usage: A scrape implies a relatively minor
problem.

scratch: to come up to scratch
to meet the required standard
The expression to come up to scratch was
originally to come up to the scratch.
Early boxing knew none of the sophis­
tication of the sport today. Bouts took
place in the open air and contestants
fought with their bare fists. Both fighters
began the bout with their left foot on a
line, known as ‘the scratch’, scored in the
earth between them. The fight was not
divided up into rounds but simply went
on until one contestant was knocked
down. The fighters were then permitted
to break for thirty seconds before being
given a count of eight during which they
both had to come up to the scratch once
more. A fighter who was unable to do
so was no longer fit to continue and his
opponent was declared the winner.
Today, if a boxer is not dedicated
enough to submit to a rigorous training
programme, then it is unlikely that he will
ever come up to scratch and reach a high
enough standard to be selected to fight.
By extension, candidates for a job, con­
cert pianists, theses and reports all need
to come up to scratch, to meet the basic
requirements for success.

system, as in this news item:

Seals have been used for millennia to
authenticate documents. They have at
different periods been carved precious
stones impressed on clay, lead and wax
seals, and signet rings. A document with
a seal, then, was approved. The seal
gave it legal status, as in the contracts of
medieval times, or simply ensured confi­
dentiality, as with personal corre­
spondence.
O ther phrases refer back to some of
these procedures: signed, sealed and

sealed orders; a sealed book.

seventh heaven, in the_________
in ecstasy, in sheer delight
Muslims maintain that there are seven
heavens which correspond to the seven
planets ruling the universe. Seven is
widely considered to be symbolically the
perfect number. They believe that each
level of heaven i$ made of a precious
metal or stone and that each is the
domain of a servant of the Most High.
The seventh heaven is the most glorious
and is governed by Abraham, who pre­
sides over creatures eternally singing the
praises of God.
Towards the end of the Middle Ages
the cabbalists, steeped in the occult,
reinforced this ancient tradition by
making mystical interpretations of the
Jewish cabbala (the oral tradition passed
clown through Moses). They concurred
that there were seven heavens, the
seventh being the dwelling place of God
and his most holy angels. Someone in the
seventh heaven, therefore, is in a realm of
complete bliss.
Presently the bells were ringing out in Meg
Speedwell's honour, and the children were
strewing daisies on which Meg Speedwell

with her head in the air and her heart in

This is a favourite expression of poli­
ticians when criticising the policies and
performance of another party. Shambles
comes from the Anglo-Saxon scamel,
meaning ‘stool’ and in the singular form
a shamble was a little counter or bench
where a butcher displayed his goods. In
medieval towns each street would be
occupied by a particular trade or guild.
Several British towns, Nottingham and
York among them, still have streets
named The Shambles which would once
have had a whole row of butchers’ stalls.
From here shambles was used to describe
a slaughterhouse and, figuratively, a
place of carnage and bloodshed. Modern
usage has weakened the sense to ‘a state
of disorder, a mess’.

sheep: to separate the sheep from

to separate the good from the bad
This phrase comes from the Bible.
Matthew 25:32 reads: ‘A n d before him
shall be gathered all nations: and he shall
separate them one from another as a
shepherd divideth his sheep from the
goats. ’
Sheep and goats were equally valued
in Palestine for their provision of cheese,
milk and meat. In addition, sheep were

kept for their wool, and goats’ hair could
be twisted into ropes or woven into cloth.
Goatskins were made into bottles to hold
water or wine.
There is a figurative distinction made
between the animals, however. In biblical
parables sheep are helpless creatures in
need of care, guidance and protection.
Goats, on the other hand, often represent
sin or condemnation (e.g. scapegoat).
And so it is with this parable; the sheep
are those who belong to God and the
goats are those who are judged un­
worthy.
The examples of uses of this phrase
show that sheep and goats need not
necessarily refer to people. The
expression can be used to categorise any­
thing into sets of ‘good, worthwhile’ and
‘bad, not worth bothering with’.
N o two persons can agree on what is good
art, so it is not possible to make a sheepand-goat division between religious and
individualistic art.

One suggestion is that a person is manag­

afford to buy anything more expensive
than a shoelace. W ebster’s Dictionary
mentions that shoestrings were amongst
the articles commonly carried by street
vendors. Perhaps living or running a busi­

business of all - that of the street sales­
man who eats or buys new stock only if his
sales of these humble items are sufficient.

A shrift is a confession made to a priest
after which absolution is given. In the
seventeenth century criminals were taken
out and executed upon receiving sen­
tence. They were entitled to make their
confession but were often given only a
few moments to do so and so a short shrift
was made.
The word shrift comes from the verb
shrive meaning ‘to hear confession’. The
past tense of the verb is shrove, hence
Shrove Tuesday, the day immediately
before Lent and a holiday when people
went to confession, then made merry with
sport and feasting.

to ‘show a leg' the crew were expected
to get up and look lively but a woman
who wished to sleep in had to dangle a
leg over the edge of the hammock to
prove that she, and not a rating, was the
occupant.
A similar phrase, shake a leg, means
‘to hurry up, to get a job done faster’.
In an obsolete sense, it once meant ‘to

Then again, its roots may lie in the
study of anatomy. It was not until 1832
that the dissection of a body for study
and research was permitted by law. The
demand for bodies soared, but there were
few to be had. Some doctors resorted to
unscrupulous dealings with grave robbers
who dug up corpses and sold them at
exorbitant prices. This macabre ex­
change was a matter of utmost secrecy
and many an ambitious physician had a
skeleton in his cupboard.
The expression appeared in print in
1845 in an article by Thackeray for Punch
magazine. Thackeray used it again ten
years later in a piece attacking the Newcome family. But they must have our sym­
pathy, for there can be few families then
or since who do not nurse little secrets they
would rather not publish abroad.
They are dull. Everybody knows them.
They are not the skeleton in everybody’s

relative who is a cheerful wastrel and turns
up at inconvenient moments to borrow five
shillings; the skeleton is exciting.

usage: American usage has a skeleton in

skin: by the skin of one’s teeth
just about, by the narrowest of margins
This evocative phrase is biblical but it is
also a misquotation. Job 19:20 reads: ‘My
bone cleaveth to my skin and to my flesh,
and I am escaped with the skin o f my
teeth. ’ Job meant that all he had escaped
with was the skin of his teeth. Everything
else had been taken away from him: his
family, his possessions, his friends and his
health. The misquotation by the skin o f
my teeth leads us into a different
interpretation of the phrase from the
original: that the speaker has just about
escaped, that it was a close run thing.
Nevertheless, the misquotation is here
to stay.

In Lethal Weapon 3, which is said to have
much more comedy and twice as many
thrills, Riggs and Murtaugh, Glover's
character, have been demoted to walking

O ’FA R R E LL , Repeat Performance, 1942.

In one of Aesop’s fables entitled The Fox
and the Grapes, the fox finds herself
unable to reach the succulent grapes
growing high on a vine above her and, in
a fit of pique, declares that they are sour.
The implication is clear. He who longs for
the unattainable may be goaded by his
lack of success into making ungenerous
and scornful remarks to soothe his anger.

usage: It is a shame that a phrase so
evocative should become so hackneyed.
With the skin o f one's teeth is not
common. Informal.

What can be more reasonable than that the
successful should shape the future? Would
you have the failures decide it? That would
be merely sour grapes.

Advertisements
Perhaps the most creative use of language in newspapers isn’t in the
articles or news items, it’s in the advertisements. Advertising copywriters
know they have to catch and hold the reader’s attention. They often do
this, for instance, with a clever play on words. You read the words and
understand them one way and then, suddenly, you realise that another
interpretation is possible. Through that ambiguity the advertiser has
caught your attention and in the end, he hopes, you’ll buy his product.
Under the picture of a new car recently available on the market are the
words: ‘Not another family saloon.’ The dual interpretation of that phrase
depends on the stress, rhythm and intonation of how it is pronounced.
Misread it by putting the stress on the second word, thereby projecting a
message the advertiser clearly would not want, and that incongruity makes
you look again and pay conscious attention to the alternative pronunci­
ation and message that he does want to get across.
Idioms are part of the stock-in-trade of the advertiser’s art. One poster
on the London Underground showed some girls wearing different
coloured jeans, but none the traditional blue ones. Underneath were the
words: ‘Jeanius is having ideas out of the blue.’
On one level, that means the jeans are not the ordinary blue jeans but
ones in a range of other colours. But there is also the suggestion that
these new jeans are a sudden piece of inspiration, a stroke of genius. For
out of the blue is an idiom which means ‘quite unexpectedly’ and genius
often involves getting a brilliant idea suddenly, in a flash of illumination.
That’s very clever, but that’s not quite the end of it, because it’s not genius
that they are talking about, but jeanius. That is another play on words,
for the product they are selling, after all, is a pair of jeans.
Many people think that dickens is linked in some way with the Victorian
novelist. It isn’t, as the entry in this book makes clear. However, a minor
inaccuracy of that kind should not take away from this very clever play
on words:
When it came to selecting books for a journey, Victorian travellers had
to contend with novels that came in three-volume editions and cost thirty
shillings. A dickens o f a price. (W. H. Smith advertisement, Daily Mail,
October 2, 1991)
Next time you are reading a magazine, do look at the advertisements.
You may not buy the product, but you will enjoy the advertiser’s skill in
playing with words and idioms.

spick and span________________
clean and neat, in perfect order
It was only in the mid nineteenth century
that spick and span came to mean ‘tidy,
clean and orderly’. Formerly the phrase
was spick and span-new, equivalent to
brand new.
The phrase has its origins in an Ice­
landic word spannyr, itself compounded
from span (a chip of wood) and nyr
(new). The sense was ‘as new as a shaving
freshly cut from the block’. Middle Eng­
lish had the expression span-new.
Chaucer uses the phrase in Troylus and
Cryseyde: ‘This take was aie span-newe to
begin. ’
Spick (spike or nail) was added to
form the extended expression in the six­
teenth century. Samuel Pepys remarked

The story goes that ancient Greeks were
very particular about the sort of person
they allowed into membership of their
numerous secret societies. If a candidate
presented himself to a group, his applica­
tion was put to the vote. A discreet voting
system was devised whereby members
walked past a jar and dropped a single
bean into it. White showed approval and
black registered disapproval. Just a few
negative votes would be enough to reject
the candidate. Only officials in the society
had the right to know how many black
beans the jar contained but, occasionally,

‘Abstain from beans’ was interpreted by
Plutarch as a warning to keep out of poli­

fo r voting upon the removal o f magistrates
from office’ (Moralia: Education o f Chil­
dren, cAD 95), and the proverb was
known in sixteenth-century England. In
the eighteenth century certain British
clubs used a similar method of selecting
members (see to blackball someone).
Unfortunately, the expression itself has
only been in circulation since the 1920s
when it gained popularity in America
before coming to Britain. Perhaps it has
more to do with a farmer or storekeeper
being invited to reveal the quality of his
crop or merchandise than with the world
of the ancients.

The spout was a type of lift found in a
pawnbroker’s shop. Articles to be
pawned were put into it and hauled up to
the rooms above where they were stored.
Belongings that had gone up the spout
were out of service, totally useless to the
owner until they were redeemed.
More recently the phrase has become a
euphemism for ‘pregnant’, though
whether it is intended to describe inter­
course or simply refer to the fact that the
woman is temporarily out of action is
unclear.

The explanation normally given for this
phrase is that before the days of televised
sport, soccer enthusiasts would spend
Saturday afternoons huddled round the
wireless listening to live commentary. The
Radio Times printed a plan of the pitch
which was divided into squares, each with
a number. In the 1930s, for example, Cap­
tain H B Wakelam gave rugby comment­
aries in which an assistant would murmur
‘Square six’ . . . ‘Square two’ as the ball
moved about the field. Playing the ball
back to square one meant losing maxi­
mum territorial advantage and, by exten­
sion, it meant ‘back to the beginning’.
Opponents of this explanation suggest
that the phrase was in use before the days
of radio commentaries and its origin is
best found in hopscotch or in board games
such as Snakes and Ladders, where a
penalty might involve returning to the
start - square one.

stalking horse, a
a less acceptable purpose hidden behind
a more attractive facade
The problem of any huntsman is how to
get close enough to the game to take a
good shot. In the Middle Ages, the stalk­
ing horse answered this need. Horses
were trained to provide cover for fowlers
who hid behind them whilst stealthily
creeping up on their quarry. Later real
horses were no longer used but were
replaced by movable screens made in the
shape of a horse.
In modern times there has been an
extension of the meaning, particularly in
politics. Sir Anthony Meyer stood in
opposition to Mrs Thatcher in 1989 for the
leadership of the Conservative Party. No
one expected him to win; the purpose of
the challenge was to demonstrate that
there was opposition to the incumbent
and perhaps also prepare the way for a
weightier challenger on a future occasion.
Sir Anthony was widely described in the
press as a stalking horse. And, in the
event, Mrs Thatcher was deposed the fol­
lowing year.
He uses his folly like a stalking-horse and

stone: to leave no stone unturned
to make every effort possible to accom­

After the defeat of the Persians by the
Greeks at Plataea (477 BC), Polycrates
decided to look for treasure rumoured to
have been left in the tent of the Persian
general Mardonius. Unable to find it, he
resorted to the oracle at Delphi which
instructed him to ‘move every stone’.
Polycrates resumed his search and found
the treasure.
The phrase rapidly became semiproverbial. Aristophanes in 410 BC called
it ‘the old proverb’ (The Thesmophoriazusae) and Becon in 1560 ‘the common
proverb’ (A New Catechisme).

about something of little importance.
‘Excitabat fluctus in simpulo’ is a neat
little metaphor used by Cicero. Trans­
lated it reads, ‘He whipped up waves in a
ladle.’ Some commentators suggest that
the storm in a teacup is a variation of
this saying. According to Partridge, other
distinguished people have played with the
expression, notably the Duke of
Ormond’s ‘storm in a cream-bowl’
(1678), Grand Duke Paul of Russia’s
‘tempest in a glass of water’ (c l790) and
Lord Thurlow’s ‘storm in a wash-hand
basin’ (1830). Storms in teacups do not
appear to have arisen until the nineteenth
century.
For all that, his sympathies had been

The Bible and Shakespeare
Some works have had a quite stunning impact on the cultures of the globe
on which we live. For example, parts of the Old Testament of the Bible
have been in existence for several thousand years and the whole Bible has
been translated (in part, if not yet in its entirety) into many hundreds of
languages. Similarly, great works of literature have been read in transla­
tion far beyond the confines of their original language. Moliere, Cervantes
and Dostoevski have had a ready audience that transcends their time and
culture.
And so it is within Britain. Some works have exerted an immense
influence on language and culture over centuries. As any listener to the
radio programme Desert Island Discs would know, the two most important
works are the Bible and Shakespeare.
The most prolific author
It is not very surprising that one authority lists ninety phrases coming
from Shakespeare’s work. That is, ninety phrases, not ninety quotations,
of which we could all probably recognise hundreds.
Many expressions we use every day, and never for a moment think they
go all the way back to Shakespeare. In the mind's eye, for example, with
bated breath and out o f joint.
There are quite a few more which sound informal to modern-day ears.
Shakespeare himself wasn’t afraid of contemporary colloquialisms in his
plays. For instance, to lay it on with a trowel, which means ‘to flatter
somebody excessively’, or ‘to overdo something’. And there's the rub,
which means ‘that is where the problem lies’.
These expressions are familiar to us today through their telling appear­
ance in Shakespeare’s writings. But it does not necessarily follow that
they are his invention. His plays are full of the sayings of contemporary
popular speech. There's the rub, for instance, actually comes from the
game of bowls. Out o f joint has been found three hundred years before
the date of Hamlet, in which it appears.
In such cases as these, he appears to have fixed these phrases in the
popular mind. But on the whole, when nothing else is known, other
phrases seem to bear the stamp of his invention. Clearly we owe a great
idiomatic debt to Shakespeare.
The most prolific book
The works of Shakespeare have been such a rich source of idioms that it


    evince -p 188 /media/bluelegend/Verbatim/Empire/Doks/Lang/en-idiomdict2.pdf &

181

is difficult to believe that one book has been even more influential. For
centuries the Bible was the book that was most read and quoted in Britain.
It’s no wonder, then, that many idiomatic phrases have been added to the
language from its pages. Moreover, it’s one particular translation - that
authorised by King James in 1611 - from which they nearly all come.
in the twinkling of an eye: Generally, we are unaware of the biblical source
of an expression. Only a student of early modern English, or a careful
reader of the Bible, would connect this phrase with a passage in the New
Testament where Paul is talking about what will happen when Christ
returns to earth: We shall all be changed in a moment, in the twinkling o f
an eye, at the last trumpet (1 Corinthians 15:52).
In the twinkling o f an eye is a translation of a traditional Greek phrase,
suggesting ‘in the time it takes to cast a glance, or to flutter an eyelid’.
to play the fool: In some cases the sense of an expression has changed
since 1611. When Saul, the king, admits his guilt for following David and
trying to kill him, he is obviously referring to an act of great seriousness:
I have sinned: return, my son, David: for I will no more do thee harm,
because my soul was precious in thine eyes this day. Behold, I have played
the fool, and have erred exceedingly (1 Samuel 26:21).
Today we use the expression in relation to something unimportant and
trivial, as Kingsley Amis does here: Come down and stop playing the fool.
I’ve got a few things to say to you and you’d better listen.

• strain at a gnat and swallow a camel •

strain at a gnat and swallow a
camel, to_____________________
to be preoccupied with the trivial rather
than the important, with details rather
than major matters
This biblical expression meaning ‘to fuss
over insignificant matters while accepting
glaring faults’ can be found in Matthew
23:24. Jesus criticises the scribes and
Pharisees for their bad example to the
people in meticulously observing less
important areas of the law whilst failing
to observe the weighty issues of justice,
mercy and faithfulness. The law, says
Jesus, should be kept in its entirety:
‘These ought ye to have done, and not to
leave the other undone. Ye blind guides,
who strain at a gnat, and swallow a camel ’
(Authorised Version, 1611)
The expression is commonly thought to
describe someone who has difficulty in
swallowing a gnat but none at all in swal­
lowing a camel. In fact the original Greek
text does not read ‘strain at’, as the A uth­
orised Version translates it, but ‘strain
out’ and refers to the practice of straining
wine before it was drunk to remove the
tiny insects which bred in it while it was
fermenting. The New International Ver­
sion of the Bible (1973) correctly trans­
lates the words as ‘strain out’ but, of
course, ‘strain at’ is now part of our idio­
matic language and the expression’s mis­
leading wording will remain.
Mr Gosse’s view seems to be, in fact, the
precise antithesis o f Dr Johnson’s; he
swallows the spirit o f Browne’s writing,

straw poll, a__________________
a superficial test of opinion
It is difficult to imagine a time when
public opinion polls were not an ingredi­
ent in general elections. Straw polls were
forerunners of these and originated in
America. In 1824 reporters from the
Harrisburg Pennsylvanian decided to
question the people of Wilmington to try
to establish their preferred presidential
candidate. The idea caught on.
The name straw poll alludes to the cus­
tom of throwing a straw up in the air in
order to determine the direction and
strength of the wind. Figurative reference
to this rural practice is much older than
the straw p o ll, however. John Selden uses
it in Table-Talk: Libels as early as the mid
seventeenth century.
Undoubtedly, spending habits are pro­

straw: the last/final straw
an insignificant event which brings about
a final catastrophe
The last straw is an abbreviation of the
proverb It’s the last straw that breaks the

It is not the original proverb, however. In
the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries
people spoke of the last feather that breaks
the horse’s back. Dickens introduced the
present-day variant in Dombey and Son
(1848).
A number of languages, among them
French, Spanish and Arabic, have
proverbs which express the same idea in
a similar way: that eventually a minute,
and seemingly insignificant, increase in
weight, effort or volume will bring about
disaster. It seems a highly relevant ex­
pression for today’s high-pressure, highstress lifestyles.

sword of Damocles, the________
impending doom, an imminent threat
Damocles’ story is an ancient one
recorded in the works of Horace and Persius, amongst others. It was alluded to in
English literature in the sixteenth century
but received scant attention until the
nineteenth century.
The story tells of Dionysius, ruler of
Syracuse around 400 BC, who, night and
day, was compelled to listen to the syco­
phantic murmurings of Damocles lauding
his power and riches. The exasperated
Dionysius finally invited him to taste this
good fortune for himself, urging him to
take his own seat at the banqueting table.
Damocles accepted eagerly and was
enjoying the feast when, glancing
upwards, he was horrified to see a large
sword suspended above his head by a
single hair. This, explained Dionysius,
was a symbol of the insecurity which
everyone holding power and position is
forced to live with.

tack: on the right/wrong tack
following the right/wrong course of action
When a sailing ship needs to head into
the wind it has to steer a zig-zag course
to make progress. This is known as tack­
ing. A ship on the wrong tack will make
no headway.
To go (o ff) on another tack is from the
same source and means ‘to take another
course of action than that previously
followed’.
People are quite on the wrong tack in
offering less than they can afford to give;
they ought to offer more, and work
backward.

tarred with the same brush
considered to show the same faults or

This expression seems to originate with
the shepherd and his flock. Formerly,
sheep sores were treated by dabbing them
with tar, the same brush sufficing to dress
the sores of every sheep in the flock. A
tar brush might also be used to daub a
special mark of ownership upon every
fleece, so that each sheep was identified
as being a member of the same flock.

Samuel Pepys’ Diary for 1664 supposedly
reports how Charles II was once at a ban­
quet with the diarist, who was entertain­

The subject of flying fish came up in con­

in disbelief, all except for an officer in

glimpsed these creatures. The king was
convinced, saying that the marines had
vast experience of the seas and customs
in different lands and that should he ever
again come across a strange tale he would
check the truth of it by telling it to the
marines.
Unfortunately, diligent searches of
Pepys’ Diary came up with no such entry
and the story proved to be an ingenious
hoax dreamed up by one W. P. Drury
who spread it abroad in a book of naval
stories he had written.
Many authorities have enthusiastically
reported Drury’s leg-pull, doubtless
because it makes such a charming stoiy.
Less fanciful but more accurate is the
explanation that the expression has
its origins in the deep contempt which the
sailors of the navy had for the men of the
marines. The navy were jealous for their
seafaring traditions and made the
marines the target of ridicule, rep­
resenting them as gullible idiots with no
understanding of life at sea. So successful
was their slander campaign that an ex­

tenterhooks, on________________
under strain, in a state of agitation or
suspense
Formerly, cloth which had just been
woven and washed was stretched out taut
to dry without wrinkling or shrinkage on
a wooden frame or tenter (from the Latin
tendere, ‘to stretch’), where it was secured
by hooks. Someone who feels tense while
awaiting the outcome of a situation is said
to be on tenterhooks.
Another early use of tenter un­
doubtedly strengthened the figurative
meaning. Because of its construction and
stretching function, a tenter was also a
word for that instrument of torture, the
rack. On the rack and on tenterhooks are
close cousins in origin and meaning.
Having ordered a light repast, they
awaited its arrival together with that o f Mr

A tether is a rope by which the freedom

one end being fastened around the ani­
mal’s neck and the other to a stake. The
expression describes the frustration of the
animal which strains to browse further

three Rs, the
the basic subjects taught at school: reading, writing and arithmetic

This is attributed to Alderman Sir Wil­
liam Curtis (1752-1829) who rose to
become Lord Mayor of London. A firm
believer in education, he once proposed
the toast at a public dinner given by the
Board of Education with: ‘The three Rs
- Riting, Reading and Rithmetic.’ The
spelling is ascribed to Sir William’s gener­
ally agreed illiteracy. However, a writer
in Notes and Queries knew someone pre­
sent at the dinner. Sir William, it appears,
had a limited education but was very
shrewd (as one might expect from a Lord
Mayor of London and a warden of the
Tower for many years). He chose the par­
ticular wording as a joke, and it was
received with great applause and merri­
ment. His political opponents seized on
the phrase and used it to portray Sir Wil­
liam as an ignoramus. If this account,
given in Walsh, is correct, then the mud
has indeed stuck.
Having read the article about Education
Secretary John Patten’s five-year-old
daughter Mary Claire and her state school,

tion o f the three Rs. Instead, religion, sex
and green issues were quoted.

Whilst it may be stated with confidence
that this expression has in some way
emerged from the use of the thumb to
judge combats in Roman arenas, there
is considerable confusion over what the
signals actually were. Those signals we
can be reasonably sure of are contrary to
what we would expect from our modern
use of thumbs up and thumbs down.
Although the thumbs-up sign signifies
approval to us, it was not the gesture that
a gladiator on the point of defeat wanted
to see. He would have preferred the audi­
ence to turn down their thumbs or, better
still, to close them up within their fists
(pollicem comprimere), a signal that he
had fought well and deserved to be
spared. O ther thumb positions - turned
up, whirled round, turned inwards or out­
wards - meant disapproval: the wounded
man should be shown no mercy but dis­

tie the knot, to________________
to take one’s marriage vows
Knots are a feature of many ancient mar­
riage rituals throughout the world. The
climax of a Hindu ceremony comes when
the garments of the bride and groom are
tied together and, thus bound, the couple
walks round holy fire. In Sikh weddings
the bride and groom both wear a scarf.
During the ceremony the bride’s father
knots the two scarves together and the
couple honour the Sikh scriptures.
Chinese Buddhists revere a certain deity,
Yue-laou, who unites with a silken cord
all predestined couples; after which,
nothing can prevent their union.
Knots are also part of our own cere­
monies. The ribbons in a bridal bouquet
traditionally should be knotted. The
knots are there to symbolise love and
unity and the solemn bond of marriage
which cannot be broken. As the old
proverb goes, ‘He has tied a knot with
his tongue he can’t untie with all his teeth’
(John Ray, English Proverbs, 1670); the
vows so easily tied are not so easily
loosened.

usage: In earlier years it was possible to

tilt at windmills, to
to face an imagined foe, to take on a fan­
ciful enemy
The phrase is from the classical Spanish
novel Don Quixote de la Mancha by Cer­
vantes in which the knight attacks some
windmills in the belief that they are mon­
strous giants. When his lance becomes
entangled in one of the whirling sails,
Don Quixote is snatched up from his
horse before falling heavily to the ground,
his act of chivalry leading only to injury.
The book was published in 1605 and such
was its popularity that by 1622 references
to Don Quixote’s battle with the wind­
mills had started to appear in English
literature with the expression ‘to have
windmills in one’s head’, meaning ‘to
have one’s head full of fanciful notions’.
This idiom, once very popular, has now
slipped from use. Tilting at windmills,
meaning battling with imagined enemies,
appeared later, around 1644.

Once the solder had set, the dam would

meaningless.

t o a T ________________________
perfect for the purpose, exact; typical,
characteristic of
The shape of the T-square, a device used
in technical drawing, has led some auth­
orities to associate this instrument with
the phrase. The origin does not lie here,
however, since the expression has been
in common use since the late seventeenth
century, some time before the T-square
was invented. Instead, T is thought to
stand for a ‘tittle’, a minute and precisely
positioned penstroke or printer’s mark.
A tiny brush stroke, for instance, was all
that distinguished the two otherwise
identical Hebrew letters ‘dalet’ and
‘resh’, and ‘tittle’ was the word chosen
by Wycliffe to translate references to this
minuscule difference in his version of the
New Testament. Thus something which
suits to a T is as perfect and exact to its
purpose as the scribe’s tittle.

The full phrase originally was Over the
top and the best o ’ luck, uttered to fellow
soldiers just about to risk death. Because
of the immensely high casualty rates and
near certainty of death or injury, luck
seemed irrelevant, so the second part was
quickly dropped.

touch wood___________________
words spoken by someone to avoid bad
luck and be blessed with good luck
The words touch wood, by which the
speaker hopes to stave off a reversal of
present good fortune, are almost always
accompanied by rapping on something
wooden. Winston Churchill, probably
tongue in cheek, said that he rarely liked
'to be any considerable distance from a
piece o f w ood\ Several theories are put
forward for the practice.
In the ancient times of the druids it was
believed that good spirits lived within the
trees. People seeking particular help
would rap on the tree to implore the
spirit’s aid or protection.
They’d knock on a tree and would
timidly say
To the Spirit who might be within there
that day;
Fairy fair, Fairy fair, wish thou me
well;
’Gainst evil witcheries weave me a
spell!
(Nora Archibald Smith, 1900)

The full expression is to trim one’s sails

one’s sails is now more commonly heard.
The term is obviously nautical, referring
to sailing ships and alludes to the setting
of the sails according to the strength of
the wind. Sails would be reefed when the
wind was strong and let out in gentler
conditions. In the same way someone
who metaphorically trims his sails
restricts his activities or expectations
according to prevailing circumstance.

Somerset Maugham used the full

Present-day use mostly confines itself to

two-faced_____________________
hypocritical, saying one thing and mean­
ing another
Two faces under one hood was the origi­
nal expression of duplicity. It was in use
in this form from the end of the four­
teenth until well into the nineteenth cen­
tury. The earliest record. is from the
Romaunt o f the Rose, written around
1400: ‘Two hedes in one hood at ones.’
A late example comes in the form of a
rhyming couplet in Bohn’s Handbook o f
Proverbs (1855):
May the man be damned and never
grow fat,
Who wears two faces under one hat.

The term refers to one of Hans Ander­
sen’^ tales in which a swan’s egg is mis­
takenly hatched by a duck, who cannot
understand how she could have produced
such an ungainly child so different from
the rest of her brood. The cygnet, scorned
for its dull feathers and its clumsiness,
hides away in shame all winter, but then
emerges from the reeds as a beautiful
swan.
In the 1950s Danny Kaye had a hit song
‘The Ugly Duckling’, telling Andersen’s
story to a new generation.
Born in Madrid, he had grown up in a
Boston fam ily, a strange, alien, lonely
child, a duckling, far from ugly, in whom
perceptive eyes foresaw the swan.
V. W. BR O O K S, New England: Indian Summer, 1940.

Present day usage has shortened the
phrase to two-faced.
See Janus-faced.
Every player must, if he is to survive,

umbrage: to take umbrage
to take offence
Umbrage has a Latin root umbra meaning
‘shade’. The word was specifically used in
English to describe the shade given by a
screen of trees, then figuratively to mean
‘the shadow of doubt or suspicion’. It
remains with us today chiefly in the
expression to take umbrage, meaning that
a person feels overshadowed by another,
giving rise to offence and resentment. No
one likes to live in another’s shadow.

Umbrella shares the same Latin root.
Originally umbrellas were used only as
shade from the sun. Jonas Hanway is said
to have introduced the umbrella as pro­
tection against the rain in about 1760, but
its use in wet weather must have been
recognised long before then, for Swift
wrote in 1710:
The tucked-up sempstress walks with
hasty strides,
While streams run down her oiled
umbrella’s sides.
Perhaps Hanway’s contribution was to
make the umbrella acceptable higher in
society, for there is historical evidence
that hackney-coachmen and sedanchairmen took umbrage over this threat
to their monopoly in protecting the
moneyed from the elements.
Product comparisons in marketing
materials are hardly unusual these days,
but S Y S T A T took umbrage. It reacted by
preparing a 25-page booklet detailing its
objections to StatSoft’s literature and then

wagon: on the wagon
teetotal, not drinking alcohol
W ater carts and wagons have been trans­
porting water or sprinkling the streets
since at least 1700. A person in the US
who had given up strong drink was de­
scribed in a colourful metaphor as need­
ing to be on the water wagon (that is,
drinking the copious quantities of water
available there, not alcohol). The ex­
pression has been in use at least through­
out the twentieth century.
Monty didn’t drink, and Clifton James
went on the wagon fo r the Empire.

usage: There is a good deal of flexibility
in the use of the phrase. Doctors can put
someone on the wagon. In a moment of
weakness, non-drinkers can fall o ff the
wagon. And so on.
The commoner contemporary US form
and only current British one is on the
wagon. Waggon is a more traditional
British spelling.

wall: to go to the wall
to suffer failure, ruin
Four hundred years ago streets were nar­
row and unlit and invited crime. The
innocent passer-by was in danger of being
set upon by thieves. Once he had gone to
the wall, that is once he had been cornered
with his back to the wall in some dark
alley, the victim knew he had no escape.
Alternatively, some medieval chapels
(such as the one in Dover Castle) pro­
vided stone seats around the walls for
those who were ailing. Everyone else was
required to stand. Hence, it is suggested,
the old saying The weak shall go to the
wall. Whichever explanation is correct,
this expression has been in figurative use
since the sixteenth century.
O ther expressions share the same
origins. To have one’s back to the wall,
means ‘to be in extreme difficulty and
have no way out’. Sir Thomas More, find­
ing himself in grave difficulty, wrote: 7
am in this matter euen at the harde walle,
and se not how to go further’ (Works,
1528). To be driven to the wall means ‘to
be forced into a hopeless situation by
circumstances’.

Waterloo; to meet one’s Waterloo
to suffer defeat after realising some
success
The expression refers to the final and
overwhelming defeat of Napoleon by the
allied forces at Waterloo, Belgium, on
June 18, 1815. The town of that name
is just ten miles south of Brussels. The
aftermath of the battle saw Napoleon’s
abdication and his captivity on the island
of St Helena until his death in 1821.
An article in Good Housekeeping (May
1991) shows how the ‘little Corsican’ may
meet his Waterloo for the second time:
what has been suggested is a direct TGV
link between Paris and London when the
Channel Tunnel is finally opened. This,
of course, will need to be given a suitably
French and heroic title, and the preferred
name at the moment is the Napoleon
Line. However, someone in the railway
bureaucracy, showing a rare sense of
humour, has made a further suggestion
about where the high-speed Napoleon
should finish its journey. Where else but
W aterloo?
The idiom emphasises total defeat,
with no mention of the victory of the
British. Perhaps their commander, the
Duke of Wellington, can take comfort in
being idiomatically overlooked since he
found linguistic fame elsewhere as the
origin for the Wellington boot!

The expression refers to the farming prac­

Someone who, figuratively speaking, sep­
arates the wheat from the chaff identifies
what is worthwhile in an undertaking and
discards that which is a waste of time.
A similar allusion is used in the Bible.
This time the wheat refers to those who
belong to Christ and are judged worthy
and the chaff to those who have rejected
him and have no place in his kingdom.
Luke 3:17 reads: ‘His winnowing fork is
in his hand to clear his threshing-floor and
to gather the wheat into his barn, but he
will burn up the chaff with unquenchable
fire. ’
The entry to separate the sheep from the
goats discusses another biblical analogy
which conveys the same spiritual message
but is also widely used in secular contexts
to describe the separating of something
good from something bad.

whipping boy, a
one who suffers the punishment for the
wrong done by another, a scapegoat

199

The Financial Times says in its special
article that Libya has been bugbear and
whipping boy fo r the Americans ever since
the Reagan administration was elected.
C O B U IL D C O R P U S, BBC World Service, 1989.

A whipping boy was an unfortunate child
who shared the rich benefits of the nur­
sery and schoolroom with a young prince
but who was beaten in his royal com­
panion’s place whenever the latter misbe­
haved. Edward V i’s punishments fell
upon Barnaby Fitzpatrick and Mungo
Murray suffered for Charles I. Presum­
ably it was considered inappropriate for
a servant or tutor to punish a child from
a family who ruled by divine right. How­
ever, not all princes were so fortunate.
George Buchanan was the Latin master
of James I. He punished his royal charge,
despite the presence of a whipping boy,
and threatened to repeat it if he carried
on being lazy.
The practice was international. King
Henry IV of France, on his adult conver­
sion to Catholicism, sent two ambassa­
dors to the Pope in 1593, where they were
symbolically whipped to atone for his pre­
vious Protestantism. Their reward was to
be made cardinals shortly afterwards!
The allusion has survived the practice
for, although royal children now have to
bear the consequences of their misdeeds
themselves, we still call someone who
suffers for someone else’s bad behaviour
a whipping boy.
[Life in] modern cities is more stressful
than life on the brink o f starvation in the
developing nations. Pollution is another
popular whipping boy, scapegoat fo r
almost any national ill in the post-war era.

white elephant, a______________
an unwanted object, especially some­
thing cumbersome
The devious kings of Siam invented an
ingenious way of ridding themselves of
any courtier who irked them. They would
present the hapless fellow with a white
elephant, a rare and sacred beast. The
cost of maintaining the creature, which
was not permitted to earn its keep as a
working animal, was excessive and gradu­
ally ruined its new owner.
A white elephant has taken on much
more diminutive proportions in modern
use, where the reference is often to
unwanted items, encumbering bric-abrac. These are sold off at the white ele­
phant stall at the local church bazaar or
school fete.

• wicket •

This is a biblical expression and comes
from the words Jesus uses in Matthew
23:27 when he condemns the scribes and
Pharisees for being outwardly orthodox
and beyond reproach but inwardly cor­
rupt, full of self-indulgence and greed:
‘Ye are like unto whited sepulchres, which
indeed appear beautiful outward, but are
fu ll o f dead men's bones, and o f all
uncleanness’ (Authorised Version).
In biblical times, contact with dead
bodies or tombs was considered ritually
unclean, so Jewish sepulchres were white­
washed to make them clearly visible to
any passer-by who feared defilement. It
seems unlikely, however, that Jesus
would call such tombs beautiful since
attractiveness was not the reason for the
whitewashing. It is more likely that he
was referring to the ornamental plasterwork which adorned the sepulchres of the
rich.
The same with love. This white love that
we have is the same. It is only the reverse,
the whited sepulchre o f the true love. True
love is dark, a throbbing together in dark­
ness, like the wild-cat in the night, when
the green screen opens and her eyes are on
the darkness.
D.

H . L A W R E N C E , ‘The Ladybird’.

So that I consider m yself a better woman
than you are. Oh yes! I know you don't
stand alone. I know there are plenty like
you in the best society - whited sepulchres,
fair without, and rottenness and dead
men's bones within.

wicket: to bat on a sticky wicket
to be faced with a difficult situation
requiring tact and diplomacy to resolve
it
The term is from cricket and alludes to
the problems faced by a batsman when
performing on a wicket that has been
saturated by rain. The fearsome West
Indians fell prey to the difficulties of a
sticky wicket in 1935: 'A Test at Kensing­
ton is akin to entering the lion's den, West
Indies having a remarkable record here.
They have won every one o f the last 10
Tests on the ground, having lost only once
- to England by four wickets in 1935 on a
sticky" pitch.' (Daily Telegraph, April
18, 1992). These days the covers are put
on overnight and come out again at the
first sign of a shower so the problem
scarcely arises, for professional cricketers
at any rate.
No one has ever doubted the Health Secre­
tary's class, elegance, style and culture.
What has been suspect is his defensive sol­
idity and technique on a sticky wicket, his
judgement on which balls to leave alone
rather than wafting them airily into the
slips.
D A IL Y M A IL, October 11, 1991.

Yesterday the doubters were silenced by a
performance on a very sticky wicket which
was solid, thorough and resolute.

It’s not cricket!
The vocabulary of general English is enlarged, even enriched, by the assimilation
of words from the jargon, slang, cant or argot of subcultures in society. The special
lexicons of business, the military, jazz musicians and thieves amongst many others
have contributed words and phrases that are used far beyond their original confines,
often with a somewhat different meaning. It would be surprising, then, if that very
English game of cricket hadn’t provided English speakers in general, and not just
cricketers, with quite a few interesting idioms.
For instance, the wicket is the central part of the playing area in the middle of
the ground where all the action is. In ordinary informal British English to be or to
bat on a sticky wicket means ‘to be in a difficult situation’. The entry for this term
has examples of its narrower and general meanings.
The quickest way to score runs in cricket is to hit the ball up in the air and right
out of the playing area. For that, you get six runs, you hit the ball fo r six. In general
English, however, the expression is used with a different meaning. You might hear,
for instance:
My wife’s death hit me fo r six, it took me months to recover.
The news knocked me fo r six, I just didn't believe it.
The sense here is that the event or happening overwhelmed me, shattered me,
dealt me as severe a blow as the batsman hitting the ball over the boundary.
There are quite a few more idioms from cricket: o ff one’s own bat,forinstance,
which means ‘on one’s own, independently, without help or assistance’.Then
there’s that lovely phrase It’s not cricket, ‘it’s not fair, honest and honourable’,
that’s so often said slightly humorously or satirically, as perhaps A. A. Milne meant
in this extract from Year in, Year out (1952):
Had Mr Mullins lit a cigarette, the ladies would have swooned and the men
muttered that it wasn’t cricket. ‘Parkinson, ’ the Host would have said, ‘remove
Mr Mullins. ’

have testified to the erratic movements of
wild geese which, apparently, make them
extremely difficult to catch.
The O ED ’s suggested origin is a game
from the Middle Ages, mentioned at
some length in Shakespeare’s Romeo and
Juliet (Act II Scene iv). The game opened
with a race on horseback, the winner
earning the right to lead the rest, who
then followed on at measured distances,
over a totally unpredictable course. The

winding path and the intervals between
the players were said to imitate the flight
of wild geese. We do not know how the
game ended, but that is the nature of a
wild goose chase - fatigue eventually
makes one call a halt.
My mind now began to misgive me that
the disappointed coachmaker had sent me
on a wild-goose errand.

W E E K E N D T E LEG R A PH , May 9, 1992.

willies: to give someone the willies
to arouse nervousness, uneasiness, fear in
someone
The origins of the phrase are shadowy
but, although the OED says it dates back
to the nineteenth century, it is possible to
make a reasonable case for much earlier
origins. It has been suggested that the
word comes from ‘willow tree’, of which
the word willy is an old form. The willow
has long been a symbol of grief and
mourning, and there are many references
to it in English literature. The saying ‘She
is in her willows . . .’ was used of a
woman who had lost her lover or spouse.
More than one authority has pointed out
that Giselle, the heroine of the nineteenth-century ballet of that name, is pos­
sessed by the Wilis, or spirits of beautiful
young girls who have died before their
wedding day and who dance to express
their anger at death.
The current sense is not one of grief
but of apprehension or nervousness.

longed to offer its people protection but
they turned away.
O Jerusalem, Jerusalem, thou that killest the prophets, and stonest them

Psalm 63:7 carries the same idea:
‘Because thou hast been my help, therefore
in the shadow o f thy wings will I rejoice. ’

the thirteenth century.

someone who is not as pleasant and harm­
less as first appears
Aesop tells a fable about a wolf who,
wrapped in a fleece, manages to sneak
into a sheepfold by pretending to be one
of the flock. Once inside he falls upon the
sheep and devours them. Our presentday expression, like many others, may
have come from Aesop’s cautionary tales,
though probably its source is the Bible.
Matthew 7:15 says: *Beware o f false
prophets, which come to you in sheep’s
clothing, but inwardly they are ravening
wolves. ’ However, such has been the
popularity of Aesop’s fables from ancient
times until the present day that Funk
(1950) suggests it is even quite possible
that the fable was the origin of the biblical
simile.

wolf: to keep the wolf from the

to ward off hunger
The w olf here is hunger. Since ancient
times, the wolf has been a symbol of pov­
erty and want. Fables depict the wolf as
ravenously hungry, in desperate need of
sustinence. The French say ‘manger
comme un loup’ (to eat like a wolf) and
the Germans have an expression ‘wolfshunger’. In English someone who eats
ravenously is said to ‘w olf’ their food.
Keeping the w olf from the door, then,
means to ward off gnawing hunger and
starvation, which our ancestors in the fif­
teenth century who first used the phrase
would have understood far better than we
do.
That hungry Wolf, want and necessity,
which now stands at his door.

A t one time anyone who considered him­
self a gentleman would wear a powdered
wig. Such creations were humorously re­
ferred to as ‘wool’ because the curls
looked rather like a fleece. The wigs
tended to be ill-fitting and cumbersome
and were easily pushed over the wearer’s
eyes so that he could not see what was
going on around him. This made him an
easy victim of theft or pranks.
Judges wear wigs to the present day
and some authorities suggest that the
expression may have been used in courts
of law when lawyers, who had succeeded
in a skilful deception, would boast at hav­
ing pulled the wool over the judge’s eyes.
The first thing she’s going to do when she

• rights for animals •
In Daniel, chapter 5, the Bible tells how
Belshazzar, King of Babylon, showed his
contempt of the Lord by holding a great
feast where wine was served in goblets
taken from the temple in Jerusalem. D ur­
ing the feast a human hand appeared,
writing on the wall. The inscription read:
Mene, mene, tekel, parsin. The only one
able to interpret the sign was the Jewish
exile, Daniel, who voiced the Lord’s
anger and prophesied the downfall of Bel­
shazzar and his kingdom. Just as Daniel
had said, that very night Belshazzar was
slain and his kingdom taken by a foreign
power. These days the message of doom
is likely to apply to a failing enterprise, a
politician or a football manager.

Rights for animals!
Animals often play a gruesome part in idioms. There are a number of
accounts in the entries of this book where they usually meet a grisly death.
A cat might get away with its life on its discovery in a bag (see pig in a
poke for how it got there), but a cat in a bag in Shakespeare’s time might
well not escape with its life if there were any bowmen about. For the full
story of that one, see no room to swing a cat. Many animals up to the
nineteenth century met a judicial death through no fault of their own dogs were by no means the only ones who could properly wear a hangdog
look! Other animals have been actively pursued for sport: fox-hunting
may give us a red herring, stag-hunting to keep at bay. The long-banned
bear-baiting spawned phrases such as to stave off. See Hammer horror
stories (page 93) for more macabre idioms.
