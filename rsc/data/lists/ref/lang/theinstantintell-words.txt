        Note to the Reader

        Do not read this book cover to cover,
        in the predictable linear fashion.

        Immerse yourself in the milieu you never had.

        Soak in the manner of the dilettante
        and emerge cultured, urbane, superior.

        Or at least sounding so.

    Achilles' heel
        [uh-kill-ees-heel|

        A weak spot.

        Achilles was the hero of Homer's epic
        poem, the Iliad, and represented
        the Greek prototype of the beautiful,
        courageous, and nearly undefeatable warrior.

        As a child, Achilles was dipped
        in the river Styx by his mother,
        a process that made him invulnerable
        except in the spot by which his
        mother held him, the heel.

            Lady Macbeth's Achilles' heel was ambition,
            and Macbeth's was Lady Macheth.

            are formed to deal specifically
            with one issue or set of issues.

            It has also come to mean slapdash,
            off the cuff, thrown together.

            Opponents of psychotherapy
            often consider it a rather ad hoc
            and bogus science.

        A distinctly unaffectionate term
        for the United States,
        probably taken from the title of an
        unfinished novel by Franz Kafka.
        It deals with the misadventures
        of a young European in a very strange and
        expressionistically depicted America.
        Thus, the “k” lends a certain surreality to
        the familiar, as Kafka was wont to do.

        It was co-opted in the 1960s by American
        radicals, and expressed their belief that
        our beloved “free” land was really as corrupt
        and authoritarian as any fascist regime.

        Amerika will be the land of the free

        only as long as it remains the home of the brave.

            evince -p 38 ~/Empire/Doks/Lang/En/instantintell.pdf &


        Cassandra was the daughter of
        Priam and Hecuba.
        Agamemnon brought her home as a prize
        from the Trojan War.

        She was a prophet cursed by Apollo to foretell
        the truth but never to be believed.
        Usually she foretold doom or disaster.

        If you're a Cassandra it means you're
        a doomsayer that no one takes seriously
        until it is too late.

        In the sequel to the film The Terminator,
        Linda Hamilton's character, who foretold

        an apocalyptic war with machines,
        was locked in a padded cell.
        Unfortunately for her captors,

        she turned out to be a Cassandra.

        A male singer who is castrated before
        reaching puberty in order to retain
        his high, pure, boyish voice.

        Needless to say, you won't find many of these
        around anymore, though the recent film Farinelli,
        which portrayed the life of a castrato,
        captured the public imagination.

        These days, the men with high voices who
        sing in choirs are called countertenors,
        and their manhood, so to speak, is intact.

        This is one of the all-time great philosophical

        The philosopher George Berkeley was known
        for his theory that nothing material existed in the
        world. It was called idealism, and according to
        it, everything in the world that seemed physical
        was nothing more than an idea in the mind.
        Dr. Samuel Johnson, the great eighteenth-century
        moralist, lexicographer, and essayist, upon hearing
        about Berkeley's theory proclaimed it absurd.
        One day while out walking, he offered his
        official refutation. He kicked a stone that was

        lying in his path and said, “I refute it thus.”

        The philosopher's prose had the bluntness and

        Faust was the protagonist, if he can be

        to experience all the world. Many plays, books,
        musicals, and films have adopted this theme,

        Boito's opera Mefistofele, and Gounod's

        Alfred Dreyfus, for which Zola was prosecuted
        for libel and later pardoned.

        He was exonerated in 1906 due in large

        ring of Gyges

        A legend told in Plato's Republic to illustrate
        that the just life is worth living.

        Gyges found a ring that made its wearer
        invisible, enabling him to do evil with
        impunity. Socrates, however, goes on to
        argue convincingly that virtue is its
        own reward, and that the just life
        is preferable to the life of Gyges.
