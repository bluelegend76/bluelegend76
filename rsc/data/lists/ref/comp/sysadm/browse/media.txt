                                            Quick question concerning mpv and mplayer - I have the documentation for it set in a file somewhere, but it might be easier to submit the question here: Let's say I wanted to play a video file with looping between two time-points, and also crop the video to a certain geometry specification. I know I can do this with vlc and set it interactively (via the Gui), but if I wanted to do that using either mpv or player, I suspect that could be specified as a directive directly from the command-line. Could you help me out on that?

                                            Absolutely! Both mpv and mplayer offer command-line options to achieve looping and cropping for your video playback. Here's how to accomplish it:

                                            Looping a Video between Time Points

                                            mpv:
                                            Use the -loop option along with the start and end times (in seconds) to specify the loop range.

                                            Bash
                                            mpv -loop start_time-end_time video_file.mp4
                                            Replace start_time and end_time with the actual starting and ending seconds of your desired loop.

                                            mplayer:
                                            Mplayer doesn't have a built-in looping option. However, you can achieve a similar effect using the -ao null option to mute the audio and loop the video playback with external tools. Here's an example using the sleep command:

                                            Bash
                                            mplayer -ao null -loop 0 video_file.mp4 & sleep ((end_time - start_time)) ; kill %1
                                            This command first plays the muted video in a loop (-loop 0) using mplayer. The sleep command pauses for the duration of your loop ((end_time - start_time)) and then kills the mplayer process using its process ID (%1).

                                            Cropping the Video

                                            mpv:
                                            Use the --crop option followed by a colon (:) separated width and height specification (e.g., width:height).

                                            Bash
                                            mpv --crop width:height video_file.mp4
                                            Replace width and height with the desired cropped dimensions.

                                            mplayer:
                                            Mplayer doesn't have a direct cropping option. However, you can achieve a similar effect by combining scaling and positioning with the -vf option. This requires some experimentation to get the exact crop you desire. Here's a basic example:

                                            Bash
                                            mplayer -vf scale=width:height video_file.mp4
                                            This scales the video to the specified width and height. You might need to adjust positioning further using options like -af for horizontal and vertical adjustments.

                                            Combining Looping and Cropping:

                                            You can combine these options in your command line to achieve both looping and cropping simultaneously:

                                            Bash
# mpv example
                                            mpv --crop width:height -loop start_time-end_time video_file.mp4

# mplayer example (with sleep for looping)
                                            mplayer -vf scale=width:height -ao null -loop 0 video_file.mp4 & sleep ((end_time - start_time)) ; kill %1
                                            Remember to replace placeholders with your specific values and adjust the scaling/positioning options in mplayer for the desired crop. While mplayer requires some workarounds, mpv offers a more straightforward approach for both looping and cropping using command-line options.

                                            I recently found out about the mpv console (shown by pressing the ` keyboard shortcut) but I'm a bit unsure about what it can be used for. Could you give me some examples of what could be done from the mpv console, i.e. could I for example jump more than one file forward in the currently playing playlist of media files, which cannot be done with the normal keyboard shortcuts in mpv?


                                            The mpv console is a powerful tool that allows you to control mpv using text commands. It can be used for a wide range of tasks, including:

                                            Navigation: Jumping to specific points in a video, changing the playback speed, and seeking forward or backward.
                                            Playback control: Pausing, resuming, stopping, and restarting playback.
                                            Audio and video settings: Adjusting volume, brightness, contrast, and other settings.
                                            Playlist management: Adding, removing, and rearranging files in the playlist.
                                            Advanced features: Accessing advanced features like subtitles, chapters, and filters.
                                            Jumping multiple files forward in the playlist:

                                            To jump forward multiple files in the playlist, you can use the playlist-jump command. For example, to jump forward 5 files, you would enter:

                                            playlist-jump 5
                                            You can also use negative numbers to jump backward. For example, to jump back 2 files:

                                            playlist-jump -2
                                            Other examples of mpv console commands:

                                            Seek to a specific time: seek 120 (seeks to 2 minutes)
                                            Change playback speed: set speed 2 (doubles playback speed)
                                            Toggle subtitles: sub on (turns subtitles on)
                                            Adjust volume: set volume 50 (sets volume to 50%)
                                            Add a file to the playlist: add file.mp4
                                            The mpv console is a versatile tool that can be used to customize your viewing experience. With a little experimentation, you can find new ways to use it to enhance your media playback.


                                            Could I for example jump forward in the playlist to the first file that matches a certain pattern or regex?


                                            Absolutely! You can use the playlist-jump command in combination with the playlist-filter command to achieve this.

                                            Here's a breakdown of the steps:

                                            Filter the playlist: Use playlist-filter to find the index of the first file that matches your pattern or regex. For example, to find the first file that contains the word "music" in its filename:

                                            playlist-filter "filename~music"
                                            Jump to the found index: Once you have the index, use playlist-jump to jump to that position in the playlist. For example, if the filter returns index 3:

                                            playlist-jump 3
                                            Combining the commands:

                                            You can combine these commands into a single expression for convenience:

                                            playlist-jump `playlist-filter "filename~music"`
                                            This will jump to the first file in the playlist that matches the pattern "filename~music".

                                            Customizing the pattern:

                                            You can customize the pattern to match different criteria. For example, to find the first file that starts with "video":

                                            playlist-jump `playlist-filter "filename^video"`
                                            To find the first file that ends with ".mp4":

                                            playlist-jump `playlist-filter "filename$.mp4"`
                                            By experimenting with different patterns, you can create powerful filters to find specific files in your playlist.

        Mpv Lua ----
                            Could you give me an example of a Lua script that could be run with load-script (i.e. showing me some code), and give me some interesting ideas of things that could be done? It seems like an interesting and powerful feature.


                            Creating a Custom Lua Script for mpv ----

                            Understanding Lua Scripts in mpv:

                            Lua scripts in mpv provide a powerful way to customize and extend its functionality. You can create scripts to automate tasks, add new features, or integrate mpv with other applications.

                            - Example: A Simple Script to Change Playback Speed

                            Here's a basic Lua script that changes the playback speed to 2x when you press the + key:

                            function mp.event.keypress(event)
                              if event.key == "+" then
                                mp.set_property("speed", 2)
                              end
                            end

                            Explanation:

                            mp.event.keypress(event): This function is called whenever a key is pressed.

                            event.key == "+": Checks if the pressed key is the + key.
                            mp.set_property("speed", 2): Sets the playback speed to 2.
                            Loading the Script:
                    To load this script in mpv, use the load-script command:
                    load-script my_script.lua
                            Replace my_script.lua with the actual filename of your script.
                    More Interesting Ideas for Lua Scripts ----
                            - Custom hotkeys: Create custom keybindings for various actions, such as toggling subtitles, adjusting volume, or jumping to specific points in a video.
                            - Automating tasks: Automate repetitive tasks, such as renaming files based on metadata or creating playlists from specific directories.
                        - Integrating with other applications: Interact with other applications using Lua's capabilities. For example, you could control mpv from a custom GUI or integrate it with a music streaming service.
                        - Customizing the interface: Create custom overlays, skins, or themes to personalize your mpv experience.
                        - Adding new features: Implement new features that aren't built into mpv by default, such as advanced subtitle options or custom video filters.
                    Additional Tips ----
                            - Explore the mpv API: The mpv API provides a wide range of functions and properties that you can use in your scripts.
                            - Use a linter: A Lua linter can help you identify errors and improve your code quality.
                            - Test your scripts thoroughly: Make sure your scripts work as expected before using them regularly.
                            - By experimenting with Lua scripts, you can unlock the full potential of mpv and create a customized media player experience that suits your needs.
                    - Let's say I wanted to play a certain video file cropped to certain dimensions.
                            There are a few ways to crop a video file in mpv:

                            1. Using the crop option:

                            You can use the crop option to specify the desired dimensions for the cropped video. For example, to crop a video to 800x600 pixels, you would use:

                            mpv --crop=800:600 file.mp4

                            You can also specify the starting position for the crop using the x and y parameters. For example, to crop a video starting from the top-left corner:

                            mpv --crop=800:600:0:0 file.mp4

                            - 2. Using the geometry option:

                            The geometry option allows you to specify the size and position of the video within the display window. You can use it to crop the video by setting the width and height to the desired dimensions and adjusting the x and y coordinates to position the cropped area.

                            For example, to crop a video to 800x600 pixels starting from the top-left corner:
                    mpv --geometry=800x600+0+0 file.mp4
                            - 3. Using the scale option:

                            The scale option can be used to scale the video to a specific size. While it doesn't directly crop the video, you can use it in conjunction with the geometry option to achieve a similar effect.

                            For example, to scale the video to 800x600 pixels and then crop it to fit the display:

                            mpv --scale=800:600 --geometry=800x600+0+0 file.mp4
                            Additional notes:

                            - The crop and geometry options can be combined to achieve more complex cropping effects.
                            - You can use the --video-out-aspect option to specify the aspect ratio of the output video. This can be useful for maintaining the original aspect ratio when cropping.

                            By experimenting with these options, you can find the best way to crop your video files to your desired specifications.
                    - Could I use teal and fennel when I develop my Lua-scripts for mpv?  # +Moonscript[!!]
