https://www.exakat.io/en/top-100-php-functions/
            The most commonly used PHP functions are string functions, and then arrays, then files. (Math is probably out of the scope, as it is mostly based on operators)
                No recently deprecated function is in the top 100.
                ext/mbstring is the first non-core extension to show up; ext/curl is the second; then Gd, filter and iconv.
                md5 is the only widely used crypto function. Sha1 is the second (#147).
                print_r is used somewhere in the code of 1 project out of 3. Somewhere…
                dirname has a high level of usage, due to dirname(dirname(dirname())) calls
                array, echo, print, empty, isset and other language constructs were not counted as functions in this ranking. They are probably trusting the first ranks anyway.
                Several functions should be replaced by operators : array_push, is_object, func_get_arg, chr, call_user_func.
                Quite a lot of calls are devoted to knowing a value’s type
                Databases are not ranked here : they are often using classes, though functions are still frequent. May be another top 100 ?
                PHP code tends to read files more than write them. It also decodes base64
                sorting with keys is more frequent than on values or with keys.
                files are read with file_get_contents, and written with fwrite

            top 100 insights

            Math is probably out of the scope, as it is mostly based on operators
            Databases are probably out of scope, as they are based on classes
            Usage of composer may also reduce the need for some native function, by federating them in a component or two, and reducing their overall usage. For example, monolog may both use log() and reduce its usage across the Open Source community.
            Extension that makes it to the top 100 : filter, json, apcu.
            Debug functions, such as print_r() or var_dump() are out of the top 100.
            array, echo, print, empty, isset and other language constructs were not counted as functions in this ranking. They are probably trusting the first ranks anyway.
            Several functions should be replaced by operators : array_push, is_object, func_get_arg, chr, call_user_func.
            Types are still a major concern of PHP code : is it a string? is it an object? No, it’s a resource!
            Type system may go a long way, but there are still return values that needs testing.
            There is also a PHP top 100 for the PHP classes. Wild ideas include top 100 PHP constants, operators, variable names,… Why not?

            I couldn’t find anywhere else on the web with this question answered so I took my own approch. The method was to take a collection of large PHP projects, including, WordPress, Mambo, Sphider, Smarty, Drupal, CodeIgniter, dump all their source code into a single file stripped of comments, and then run some simple regex over this file counting the occurance of each function.

https://code.tutsplus.com/tutorials/9-useful-php-functions-and-features-you-need-to-know--net-11304
            Even after using PHP for years, we stumble upon functions and features that we did not know about. Some of these can be quite useful, yet underused. With that in mind, I've compiled a list of nine incredibly useful PHP functions and features that you should be familiar with.

            1. Functions with Arbitrary Number of Arguments

            You may already know that PHP allows you to define functions with optional arguments. But there is also a method for allowing completely arbitrary number of function arguments.

            First, here is an example with just optional arguments:

            // function with 2 optional arguments
            function foo($arg1 = '', $arg2 = '') {

                echo "arg1: $arg1\n";
                echo "arg2: $arg2\n";

            }

            foo('hello','world');
            /* prints:
            arg1: hello
            arg2: world
            */

            foo();
            /* prints:
            arg1:
            arg2:
            */

            Now, let's see how we can build a function that accepts any number of arguments. This time we are going to utilize func_get_args():

            // yes, the argument list can be empty
            function foo() {

                // returns an array of all passed arguments
                $args = func_get_args();

                foreach ($args as $k => $v) {
                    echo "arg".($k+1).": $v\n";
                }

            }

            foo();
            /* prints nothing */

            foo('hello');
            /* prints
            arg1: hello
            */

            foo('hello', 'world', 'again');
            /* prints
            arg1: hello
            arg2: world
            arg3: again
            */

            2. Using Glob() to Find Files

            Many PHP functions have long and descriptive names. However it may be hard to tell what a function named glob() does unless you are already familiar with that term from elsewhere.

            Think of it like a more capable version of the scandir() function. It can let you search for files by using patterns.

            // get all php files
            $files = glob('*.php');

            print_r($files);
            /* output looks like:
            Array
            (
                [0] => phptest.php
                [1] => pi.php
                [2] => post_output.php
                [3] => test.php
            )
            */

            You can fetch multiple file types like this:

            // get all php files AND txt files
            $files = glob('*.{php,txt}', GLOB_BRACE);

            print_r($files);
            /* output looks like:
            Array
            (
                [0] => phptest.php
                [1] => pi.php
                [2] => post_output.php
                [3] => test.php
                [4] => log.txt
                [5] => test.txt
            )
            */

            Note that the files can actually be returned with a path, depending on your query:

            $files = glob('../images/a*.jpg');

            print_r($files);
            /* output looks like:
            Array
            (
                [0] => ../images/apple.jpg
                [1] => ../images/art.jpg
            )
            */

            If you want to get the full path to each file, you can just call the realpath() function on the returned values:

            $files = glob('../images/a*.jpg');

            // applies the function to each array element
            $files = array_map('realpath',$files);

            print_r($files);
            /* output looks like:
            Array
            (
                [0] => C:\wamp\www\images\apple.jpg
                [1] => C:\wamp\www\images\art.jpg
            )
            */
            3. Memory Usage Information

            By observing the memory usage of your scripts, you may be able optimize your code better.

            PHP has a garbage collector and a pretty complex memory manager. The amount of memory being used by your script. can go up and down during the execution of a script. To get the current memory usage, we can use the memory_get_usage() function, and to get the highest amount of memory used at any point, we can use the memory_get_peak_usage() function.

            echo "Initial: ".memory_get_usage()." bytes \n";
            /* prints
            Initial: 361400 bytes
            */

            // let's use up some memory
            for ($i = 0; $i < 100000; $i++) {
                $array []= md5($i);
            }

            // let's remove half of the array
            for ($i = 0; $i < 100000; $i++) {
                unset($array[$i]);
            }

            echo "Final: ".memory_get_usage()." bytes \n";
            /* prints
            Final: 885912 bytes
            */

            echo "Peak: ".memory_get_peak_usage()." bytes \n";
            /* prints
            Peak: 13687072 bytes
            */

            4. CPU Usage Information

            For this, we are going to utilize the getrusage() function. Keep in mind that this is not available on Windows platforms.

            print_r(getrusage());
            /* prints
            Array
            (
                [ru_oublock] => 0
                [ru_inblock] => 0
                [ru_msgsnd] => 2
                [ru_msgrcv] => 3
                [ru_maxrss] => 12692
                [ru_ixrss] => 764
                [ru_idrss] => 3864
                [ru_minflt] => 94
                [ru_majflt] => 0
                [ru_nsignals] => 1
                [ru_nvcsw] => 67
                [ru_nivcsw] => 4
                [ru_nswap] => 0
                [ru_utime.tv_usec] => 0
                [ru_utime.tv_sec] => 0
                [ru_stime.tv_usec] => 6269
                [ru_stime.tv_sec] => 0
            )

            */

            That may look a bit cryptic unless you already have a system administration background. Here is the explanation of each value (you don't need to memorize these):

                ru_oublock: block output operations
                ru_inblock: block input operations
                ru_msgsnd: messages sent
                ru_msgrcv: messages received
                ru_maxrss: maximum resident set size
                ru_ixrss: integral shared memory size
                ru_idrss: integral unshared data size
                ru_minflt: page reclaims
                ru_majflt: page faults
                ru_nsignals: signals received
                ru_nvcsw: voluntary context switches
                ru_nivcsw: involuntary context switches
                ru_nswap: swaps
                ru_utime.tv_usec: user time used (microseconds)
                ru_utime.tv_sec: user time used (seconds)
                ru_stime.tv_usec: system time used (microseconds)
                ru_stime.tv_sec: system time used (seconds)

            To see how much CPU power the script has consumed, we need to look at the 'user time' and 'system time' values. The seconds and microseconds portions are provided separately by default. You can divide the microseconds value by 1 million, and add it to the seconds value, to get the total seconds as a decimal number.

            Let's see an example:

            // sleep for 3 seconds (non-busy)
            sleep(3);

            $data = getrusage();
            echo "User time: ".
                ($data['ru_utime.tv_sec'] +
                $data['ru_utime.tv_usec'] / 1000000);
            echo "System time: ".
                ($data['ru_stime.tv_sec'] +
                $data['ru_stime.tv_usec'] / 1000000);

            /* prints
            User time: 0.011552
            System time: 0
            */

            Even though the script took about 3 seconds to run, the CPU usage was very very low. Because during the sleep operation, the script actually does not consume CPU resources. There are many other tasks that may take real time, but may not use CPU time, like waiting for disk operations. So as you see, the CPU usage and the actual length of the runtime are not always the same.

            Here is another example:

            // loop 10 million times (busy)
            for($i=0;$i<10000000;$i++) {

            }

            $data = getrusage();
            echo "User time: ".
                ($data['ru_utime.tv_sec'] +
                $data['ru_utime.tv_usec'] / 1000000);
            echo "System time: ".
                ($data['ru_stime.tv_sec'] +
                $data['ru_stime.tv_usec'] / 1000000);

            /* prints
            User time: 1.424592
            System time: 0.004204
            */

            That took about 1.4 seconds of CPU time, almost all of which was user time, since there were no system calls.

            System Time is the amount of time the CPU spends performing system calls for the kernel on the program's behalf. Here is an example of that:

            $start = microtime(true);
            // keep calling microtime for about 3 seconds
            while(microtime(true) - $start < 3) {

            }

            $data = getrusage();
            echo "User time: ".
                ($data['ru_utime.tv_sec'] +
                $data['ru_utime.tv_usec'] / 1000000);
            echo "System time: ".
                ($data['ru_stime.tv_sec'] +
                $data['ru_stime.tv_usec'] / 1000000);

            /* prints
            User time: 1.088171
            System time: 1.675315
            */

            Now we have quite a bit of system time usage. This is because the script calls the microtime() function many times, which performs a request through the operating system to fetch the time.

            Also you may notice the numbers do not quite add up to 3 seconds. This is because there were probably other processes on the server as well, and the script was not using 100% CPU for the whole duration of the 3 seconds.

            5. Magic Constants

            PHP provides useful magic constants for fetching the current line number (__LINE__), file path (__FILE__), directory path (__DIR__), function name (__FUNCTION__), class name (__CLASS__), method name (__METHOD__) and namespace (__NAMESPACE__).

            We are not going to cover each one of these in this article, but I will show you a few use cases.

                When including other scripts, it is a good idea to utilize the __FILE__ constant (or also __DIR__ , as of PHP 5.3):

            // this is relative to the loaded script's path
            // it may cause problems when running scripts from different directories
            require_once('config/database.php');

            // this is always relative to this file's path
            // no matter where it was included from
            require_once(dirname(__FILE__) . '/config/database.php');

            Using __LINE__ makes debugging easier. You can track down the line numbers:

            // some code
            // ...
            my_debug("some debug message", __LINE__);
            /* prints
            Line 4: some debug message
            */

            // some more code
            // ...
            my_debug("another debug message", __LINE__);
            /* prints
            Line 11: another debug message
            */

            function my_debug($msg, $line) {
                echo "Line $line: $msg\n";
            }
            6. Generating Unique ID's

            There may be situations where you need to generate a unique string. I have seen many people use the md5() function for this, even though it's not exactly meant for this purpose:
            1
            2

            // generate unique string
            echo md5(time() . mt_rand(1,1000000));

            There is actually a PHP function named uniqid() that is meant to be used for this.

            // generate unique string
            echo uniqid();
            /* prints
            4bd67c947233e
            */

            // generate another unique string
            echo uniqid();
            /* prints
            4bd67c9472340
            */

            You may notice that even though the strings are unique, they seem similar for the first several characters. This is because the generated string is related to the server time. This actually has a nice side effect, as every new generated id comes later in alphabetical order, so they can be sorted.

            To reduce the chances of getting a duplicate, you can pass a prefix, or the second parameter to increase entropy:

            // with prefix
            echo uniqid('foo_');
            /* prints
            foo_4bd67d6cd8b8f
            */

            // with more entropy
            echo uniqid('',true);
            /* prints
            4bd67d6cd8b926.12135106
            */

            // both
            echo uniqid('bar_',true);
            /* prints
            bar_4bd67da367b650.43684647
            */

            This function will generate shorter strings than md5(), which will also save you some space.
            7. Serialization

            Have you ever needed to store a complex variable in a database or a text file? You do not have to come up with a fancy solution to convert your arrays or objects into formatted strings, as PHP already has functions for this purpose.

            There are two popular methods of serializing variables. Here is an example that uses the serialize() and unserialize():

            // a complex array
            $myvar = array(
                'hello',
                42,
                array(1,'two'),
                'apple'
            );

            // convert to a string
            $string = serialize($myvar);

            echo $string;
            /* prints
            a:4:{i:0;s:5:"hello";i:1;i:42;i:2;a:2:{i:0;i:1;i:1;s:3:"two";}i:3;s:5:"apple";}
            */

            // you can reproduce the original variable
            $newvar = unserialize($string);

            print_r($newvar);
            /* prints
            Array
            (
                [0] => hello
                [1] => 42
                [2] => Array
                    (
                        [0] => 1
                        [1] => two
                    )

                [3] => apple
            )
            */

            This was the native PHP serialization method. However, since JSON has become so popular in recent years, they decided to add support for it in PHP 5.2. Now you can use the json_encode() and json_decode() functions as well:

            // a complex array
            $myvar = array(
                'hello',
                42,
                array(1,'two'),
                'apple'
            );

            // convert to a string
            $string = json_encode($myvar);

            echo $string;
            /* prints
            ["hello",42,[1,"two"],"apple"]
            */

            // you can reproduce the original variable
            $newvar = json_decode($string);

            print_r($newvar);
            /* prints
            Array
            (
                [0] => hello
                [1] => 42
                [2] => Array
                    (
                        [0] => 1
                        [1] => two
                    )

                [3] => apple
            )
            */

            It is more compact, and best of all, compatible with javascript and many other languages. However, for complex objects, some information may be lost.

            8. Compressing Strings

            When talking about compression, we usually think about files, such as ZIP archives. It is possible to compress long strings in PHP, without involving any archive files.

            In the following example we are going to utilize the gzcompress() and gzuncompress() functions:

            $string =
            "Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur
            adipiscing elit. Nunc ut elit id mi ultricies
            adipiscing. Nulla facilisi. Praesent pulvinar,
            sapien vel feugiat vestibulum, nulla dui pretium orci,
            non ultricies elit lacus quis ante. Lorem ipsum dolor
            sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit. Aliquam
            pretium ullamcorper urna quis iaculis. Etiam ac massa
            sed turpis tempor luctus. Curabitur sed nibh eu elit
            mollis congue. Praesent ipsum diam, consectetur vitae
            ornare a, aliquam a nunc. In id magna pellentesque
            tellus posuere adipiscing. Sed non mi metus, at lacinia
            augue. Sed magna nisi, ornare in mollis in, mollis
            sed nunc. Etiam at justo in leo congue mollis.
            Nullam in neque eget metus hendrerit scelerisque
            eu non enim. Ut malesuada lacus eu nulla bibendum
            id euismod urna sodales. ";

            $compressed = gzcompress($string);

            echo "Original size: ". strlen($string)."\n";
            /* prints
            Original size: 800
            */



            echo "Compressed size: ". strlen($compressed)."\n";
            /* prints
            Compressed size: 418
            */

            // getting it back
            $original = gzuncompress($compressed);

            We were able to achive almost 50% size reduction. Also the functions gzencode() and gzdecode() achive similar results, by using a different compression algorithm.

            9. Register Shutdown Function

            There is a function called register_shutdown_function(), which will let you execute some code right before the script finishes running.

            Imagine that you want to capture some benchmark statistics at the end of your script execution, such as how long it took to run:

            // capture the start time
            $start_time = microtime(true);

            // do some stuff
            // ...

            // display how long the script took
            echo "execution took: ".
                    (microtime(true) - $start_time).
                    " seconds.";

            At first this may seem trivial. You just add the code to the very bottom of the script and it runs before it finishes. However, if you ever call the exit() function, that code will never run. Also, if there is a fatal error, or if the script is terminated by the user (by pressing the Stop button in the browser), again it may not run.

            When you use register_shutdown_function(), your code will execute no matter why the script has stopped running:

            $start_time = microtime(true);

            register_shutdown_function('my_shutdown');

            // do some stuff
            // ...


            function my_shutdown() {
                global $start_time;

                echo "execution took: ".
                        (microtime(true) - $start_time).
                        " seconds.";
            }

                1. array()

                This handy little guy creates an array for you. Here we’ll create an associative array with two keys, and then place an an associative array inside one and an indexed array inside the other.


                <?php
                $array = array (
                        'websites' => array (
                                'Search' => 'Google',
                                'Social' => 'Facebook',
                                'News' => 'NY Times'
                        ),
                        'friends' => array (
                                'Chris',
                                'Jim',
                                'Lynn',
                                'Jeff',
                                'Joanna'
                        )
                );

                print_r ( $array );
                ?>

                PHP

                And it goes a little something like this, HIT IT:

                Array
                (
                    [websites] => Array
                        (
                            [Search] => Google
                            [Social] => Facebook
                            [News] => NY Times
                        )

                    [friends] => Array
                        (
                            [0] => Chris
                            [1] => Jim
                            [2] => Lynn
                            [3] => Jeff
                            [4] => Joanna
                        )

                )

                2. is_array()

                Checks whether the variable is an array. Returns TRUE if the variable is an array, and FALSE otherwise. Used like so:


                <?php
                echo is_array($array);  //1 or TRUE
                ?>

                PHP

                Learn more about is_array() at http://us2.php.net/manual/en/function.is-array.php
                3. in_array()

                We may often want to check if a certain value is in one of our arrays. Recall from our example above that we assigned an indexed array of friends to the ‘friends’ key of our example array. Let’s see if ‘Jeff’ was included.


                $result = in_array('Jeff', $array['friends']);

                print_r($result); // 1 or TRUE

                PHP

                Ah ha, turns out he was. With in_array(), the first argument is what you are looking for, and the second argument is the array you will check in. Learn more about in_array() at http://us3.php.net/manual/en/function.in-array.php
                4. array_merge

                Remember we had some websites and friends in the array from the prior example. In fact we stored an array of values in those arrays. Well I’m feeling lazy and I don’t want to work with two arrays. I just want to work with one, so let’s merge those two arrays together!


                <?php
                $array = array (
                        'websites' => array (
                                'Search' => 'Google',
                                'Social' => 'Facebook',
                                'News' => 'NY Times'
                        ),
                        'friends' => array (
                                'Chris',
                                'Jim',
                                'Lynn',
                                'Jeff',
                                'Joanna'
                        )
                );

                $merged = array_merge ( $array ['websites'], $array ['friends'] );

                print_r ( $merged );
                ?>

                PHP

                And bingo bango, we now have one array created out of two!

                Array
                (
                    [Search] => Google
                    [Social] => Facebook
                    [News] => NY Times
                    [0] => Chris
                    [1] => Jim
                    [2] => Lynn
                    [3] => Jeff
                    [4] => Joanna
                )

                Learn more about array_merge() at http://us3.php.net/manual/en/function.array-merge.php
                5. array_keys

                Let’s now extract all the keys from our $merged array by adding these lines:


                <?php
                $keys = array_keys ( $merged );
                print_r ( $keys );
                ?>

                PHP

                And now you can see the keys of our $merged array become the values of the array returned from array_keys()!

                Array
                (
                    [0] => Search
                    [1] => Social
                    [2] => News
                    [3] => 0
                    [4] => 1
                    [5] => 2
                    [6] => 3
                    [7] => 4
                )

                Learn more about array_keys() at http://us3.php.net/manual/en/function.array-keys.php
                6. array_key_exists()

                With array_key_exists() we can perform a validation similar to the way we would with isset(). You pass a key to search for and an array to search in, and the function will return TRUE if the key exists in the array provided. Building on our prior example, let’s see if the 7th key is set:


                <?php
                $keys = array_keys ( $merged );
                $exists = array_key_exists('7', $keys);

                print_r ( $exists ); // 1 or TRUE

                echo $keys['7'];  //The key of 7 has value of 4
                ?>

                PHP

                Learn more about array_key_exists() at http://us3.php.net/manual/en/function.array-key-exists.php
                7. array_shift()

                Let’s remember our original $array which had two keys in it, ‘websites’ and ‘friends’. I want each key to have it’s own variable name in the program, how can I do that? Well, let’s apply the array_shift() function to $array, return the result to a variable $shifted, and examine both variables.


                <?php
                $array = array (
                        'websites' => array (
                                'Search' => 'Google',
                                'Social' => 'Facebook',
                                'News' => 'NY Times'
                        ),
                        'friends' => array (
                                'Chris',
                                'Jim',
                                'Lynn',
                                'Jeff',
                                'Joanna'
                        )
                );

                $shifted = array_shift ( $array );

                print_r ( $array );

                print_r ( $shifted );
                ?>

                PHP

                You can see the ‘websites’ key, which is the first in the array, was shifted out of the array, while the ‘friends’ key was left intact. Awesome!

                // print_r ( $array ); 'friends' is still in the original
                Array
                (
                    [friends] => Array
                        (
                            [0] => Chris
                            [1] => Jim
                            [2] => Lynn
                            [3] => Jeff
                            [4] => Joanna
                        )

                )
                // print_r ( $shifted ); 'websites' was shifted out
                Array
                (
                    [Search] => Google
                    [Social] => Facebook
                    [News] => NY Times
                )

                8. array_push

                Our newly created $shifted variable is mad. It wants back into the original $array variable to undo the shifting we have caused. Well, let’s try to apply the array_push() function to the original $array and push $shifted back onto the end of the array:


                <?php
                $array = array (
                        'websites' => array (
                                'Search' => 'Google',
                                'Social' => 'Facebook',
                                'News' => 'NY Times'
                        ),
                        'friends' => array (
                                'Chris',
                                'Jim',
                                'Lynn',
                                'Jeff',
                                'Joanna'
                        )
                );

                $shifted = array_shift ( $array );

                array_push ( $array, $shifted );

                print_r ( $array );
                ?>

                PHP

                You can see friends is now in the first position and the $shifted array is added back to the original array. Note that array_push() does not keep key => value pairs intact! We have lost our ‘websites’ key(it is now 0).

                Array
                (
                    [friends] => Array
                        (
                            [0] => Chris
                            [1] => Jim

                    [0] => Array

                9. array_pop

                Fickle mister $shifted is mad about losing his ‘websites’ key. I’m not going to be in this $array if I can’t have my original key. Ok fine then, we’ll array_pop() you right off the end of this $array one more time.


                <?php
                $array = array (
                        'websites' => array (
                                'Search' => 'Google',
                                'Social' => 'Facebook',
                                'News' => 'NY Times'
                        ),
                        'friends' => array (
                                'Chris',
                                'Jim',
                                'Lynn',
                                'Jeff',
                                'Joanna'
                        )
                );

                $shifted = array_shift ( $array );

                array_push ( $array, $shifted );

                $shifted = array_pop ( $array ); //POP!

                print_r ( $array );

                print_r ( $shifted );
                ?>

                PHP

                And there you go mister $shifted – popped off and placed back into your own array.

                Array
                (
                    [friends] => Array
                        (
                            [0] => Chris
                            [1] => Jim
                            [2] => Lynn
                            [3] => Jeff
                            [4] => Joanna
                        )

                )

                10. array_values

                Remember when we created the $merged array earlier and we got a nifty little array looking like this?

                Array
                (
                    [Search] => Google
                    [Social] => Facebook
                    [News] => NY Times
                    [0] => Chris
                    [1] => Jim
                    [2] => Lynn
                    [3] => Jeff
                    [4] => Joanna
                )

                Well, I’m not crazy about the fact that some of those keys are named and others are indexed. I’d like to grab just the values of the $merged array listed only with numeric indexes. Let use the array_values() function to do just that.


                <?php
                $array = array (
                        'websites' => array (
                                'Search' => 'Google',
                                'Social' => 'Facebook',
                                'News' => 'NY Times'
                        ),
                        'friends' => array (
                                'Chris',
                                'Jim',
                                'Lynn',
                                'Jeff',
                                'Joanna'
                        )
                );

                $merged = array_merge ( $array ['websites'], $array ['friends'] );

                $merged = array_values( $merged ); //get the values

                print_r ( $merged );
                ?>

                PHP

                Ah yes, there she is – my nicely formatted merged array with neat indexes 0 – 7 courtesy of array_values().

                Array
                (
                    [0] => Google
                    [1] => Facebook
                    [2] => NY Times
                    [3] => Chris
                    [4] => Jim
                    [5] => Lynn
                    [6] => Jeff
                    [7] => Joanna
                )

                11. array_map

                Ok all this array business has me needing a break. Let’s go shopping and buy some cool new gadgets, maybe a new iPad Air. You know, these days they tax you on everything, so when we go shopping, let’s not forget that we have to pay a 5% sales tax. We’ll use our array_map() function to help us there.


                <?php
                function salestax($price) {
                    return number_format ( ($price * 1.05), 2, '.', '' );
                }

                $items = array (
                        100,
                        50,
                        250,
                        70,
                        500
                );
                $finalcost = array_map ( 'salestax', $items );
                print_r ( $finalcost );
                ?>

                PHP

                Ok check it out. We had our array of $items to shop for, but we needed to quickly calculate the sales tax for each item at a 5% rate. Well with array_map() we can apply a function to every single array element, and return an array with the newly processed results, in this case our $finalcost – neat!

                Array
                (
                    [0] => 105.00
                    [1] => 52.50
                    [2] => 262.50
                    [3] => 73.50
                    [4] => 525.00
                )

                12. array_unique

                You know there is a lot of blogging going on out there, and the search engines want to make sure they only index unique articles. Our little internet spider came across some articles below and put them into the $index. We need to make sure they are unique however, maybe we can use array_unique() to help us out!


                <?php
                $index = array (
                        'How to Eat Apples',
                        'Surfing Safely in a Wave Pool',
                        'The Best Foods For Breakfast',
                        'How to Eat Apples',
                        '25 tips to blogging nirvana',
                        'The Best Egg Nogg Recipe for the Holidays'
                );
                $unique = array_unique ( $index );
                print_r ( $unique )
                ?>

                PHP

                Awesome! Working as designed! Our array_unique() got rid of that duplicate value in the array and returned us a new array with only unique titles. Did you spot the duplicate title in the original array?

                Array
                (
                    [0] => How to Eat Apples
                    [1] => Surfing Safely in a Wave Pool
                    [2] => The Best Foods For Breakfast
                    [4] => 25 tips to blogging nirvana
                    [5] => The Best Egg Nogg Recipe for the Holidays
                )

                13. array_slice

                Come to think of it, rather than use that array_unique() on our $index, let’s go ahead and perform some surgery on that array and extract only the inner elements, leaving the first and last entry to their own devices.


                <?php
                $index = array (
                        'How to Eat Apples',
                        'Surfing Safely in a Wave Pool',
                        'The Best Foods For Breakfast',
                        'How to Eat Apples',
                        '25 tips to blogging nirvana',
                        'The Best Egg Nogg Recipe for the Holidays'
                );
                $surgerized = array_slice ( $index, 1, 4 ); //slice it
                print_r ( $surgerized );
                ?>

                PHP

                And there you have it, by passing the array to work on, the starting offset, and the length of our extraction, we have successfully removed the middle 4 entries of our 6 element array. Bravo!

                Array
                (
                    [0] => Surfing Safely in a Wave Pool
                    [1] => The Best Foods For Breakfast
                    [2] => How to Eat Apples
                    [3] => 25 tips to blogging nirvana
                )

                14. array_diff

                Ok friends, our internet spider has been busy and it has created an updated index after some time. We’d like to examine our first index in comparison to the second and see what’s new. Let’s do it with our array_diff() function!


                <?php
                $index = array (
                        'How to Eat Apples',
                        'Surfing Safely in a Wave Pool',
                        'The Best Foods For Breakfast',
                        'How to Eat Apples',
                        '25 tips to blogging nirvana',
                        'The Best Egg Nogg Recipe for the Holidays'
                );

                $index2 = array (
                        'How to Eat Apples',
                        'Surfing Safely in a Wave Pool',
                        'The Best Foods For Breakfast',
                        'How to Eat Apples',
                        '25 tips to blogging nirvana',
                        'The Best Egg Nogg Recipe for the Holidays',
                        'Arrays with Style',
                        'PHP in the Enterprise',
                        'Douglas Crockford declares PHP his favorite language'
                );
                $diff = array_diff ( $index2, $index );
                print_r ( $diff );
                ?>

                PHP

                Awesome. Our internet spider has found 3 new articles on the internet titled, ‘Arrays with Style’, ‘PHP in the Enterprise’, and ‘Douglas Crockford declares PHP his favorite language’. By passing our updated index and original index to the array_diff() function, it returned only the new results to us.

                Array
                (
                    [6] => Arrays with Style
                    [7] => PHP in the Enterprise
                    [8] => Douglas Crockford declares PHP his favorite language
                )

                15. array_search

                My buddy was telling me about a cool article named ‘PHP in the Enterprise’, I wonder if our updated index was able to capture it yet? Let’s find out with array_search();


                <?php
                $index2 = array (
                        'How to Eat Apples',
                        'Surfing Safely in a Wave Pool',
                        'The Best Foods For Breakfast',
                        'How to Eat Apples',
                        '25 tips to blogging nirvana',
                        'The Best Egg Nogg Recipe for the Holidays',
                        'Arrays with Style',
                        'PHP in the Enterprise',
                        'Douglas Crockford declares PHP his favorite language'
                );
                $found = array_search ( 'PHP in the Enterprise', $index2 );  //  (needle,haystack)
                print_r ( $found ); // 7
                ?>

                PHP

                Well isn’t that cool? We see that it is in fact in the index at position 7, as returned from array_search()

                16. array_reverse

                When you want to turn an array upside down or rightside up, you can use the array_reverse() function. I have added some elements to our original $array so we can get a better feel for how array_reverse() treats the array with both associative and indexed properties.


                <?php
                $array = array (
                        'websites' => array (
                                'Search' => 'Google',
                                'Social' => 'Facebook',
                                'News' => 'NY Times'
                        ),
                        'friends' => array (
                                'Chris',
                                'Jim',
                                'Lynn',
                                'Jeff',
                                'Joanna'
                        ),
                        16,
                        99,
                        13,
                        'newfriend' => 'Ken'
                );

                print_r ( $array );

                $array = array_reverse ( $array );

                print_r ( $array );
                ?>

                PHP

                And here we see the results of applying the array_reverse() to our $array

                // before reverse
                Array
                (
                    [websites] => Array
                        (
                            [Search] => Google
                            [Social] => Facebook
                            [News] => NY Times
                        )

                    [friends] => Array

                17. array_unshift

                We have seen how easy it is to add items to the end of an array, but what if we need to prepend something to our array? Well that is where our nifty little array_unshift() comes in. Let’s see how it works by adding an interest of ‘music’ to our array:


                <?php
                $array = array (
                        'websites' => array (
                                'Search' => 'Google',
                                'Social' => 'Facebook',
                                'News' => 'NY Times'
                        ),
                        'friends' => array (
                                'Chris',
                                'Jim',
                                'Lynn',
                                'Jeff',
                                'Joanna'
                        ),
                        16,
                        99,
                        13,
                        'newfriend' => 'Ken'
                );

                array_unshift( $array, 'music');

                print_r ( $array );
                ?>

                PHP

                Alrighty then! Check out that interest of music at the beginning of our array!

                Array
                (
                    [0] => music
                    [websites] => Array
                        (
                            [Search] => Google
                            [Social] => Facebook
                            [News] => NY Times
                        )

                    [friends] => Array
                        (
                            [0] => Chris
                            [1] => Jim
                            [2] => Lynn
                            [3] => Jeff
                            [4] => Joanna
                        )

                    [1] => 16
                    [2] => 99
                    [3] => 13
                    [newfriend] => Ken
                )

                Maybe you’d rather prepend an associative keyed value rather than a numeric, in that case you can simply add your original array to a key value pair like so:


                <?php
                $array = array ( 'interests' => 'music' ) + $array;

                print_r ( $array );
                ?>

                PHP

                Array
                (
                    [interests] => music
                    [websites] => Array
                        (
                            [Search] => Google
                            [Social] => Facebook
                            [News] => NY Times
                        )

                    [friends] => Array
                        (
                            [0] => Chris
                            [1] => Jim
                            [2] => Lynn
                            [3] => Jeff
                            [4] => Joanna
                        )

                    [0] => 16
                    [1] => 99
                    [2] => 13
                    [newfriend] => Ken
                )
