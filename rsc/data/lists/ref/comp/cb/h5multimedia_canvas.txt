            1 - Structuring for Rich Media Applications ----
            Setting up an HTML5 test area
              WebKit rendering engine
              Gecko rendering engine
              Trident rendering engine
            Using the header tag for logos and site titles
              Use <header> elsewhere
              Content, not position
              Semantic naming
            Creating a table of contents using the nav tag
              Use <nav> elsewhere
              More semantic = more gooder
              Still evolving
            Using section tags to structure areas of a page
              Section doesn't equal div
              Section guidelines
              Still evolving
            Aligning graphics using the aside tag
              Not all <section>s are alike
              Tip to remember
              Aside from <aside>
            Displaying multiple sidebars using the aside tag
              Pull quotes good for <aside>
              Remember to validate
            Implementing the footer tag
              This happens usually
              Flexible footer content
              More flexible footer content
            Applying the outline algorithm
              Are you sure?
              An exception
              Remember accessibility
            Creating a stylish promo page in HTML5
              Try sans shiv
              Mobile first
              IE evil?
            2 - Supporting the Content ----
            Structuring a blog article
              Put your code on a diet?
              Validation as an aid, not a crutch
              Eric Meyer's funny
              Where to find validators
            Highlighting text using the mark element
              <Mark> long and prosper
              Waiting for browsers
              Is "future proof" a word?
            Using the time element
              Odd rules
              <time>'s Time will come
              Always remember SEO
            Specifying the pubdate of an article
              Still waiting on browsers
              Extra credit
              Let's end confusion
            Displaying comment blocks using the article element
              Blog comments
              Value comments
              Opportunity's yours
            Adding fonts dynamically with @font-face

              A plea to all readers
            Applying gradient effects to fonts
            Annotating visual elements using the figure and figcaption tags
              Grouping's good
              Semantics are valuable too
              <figure> vs <aside>
            3 -Styling with CSS ----
            Setting elements to display:block
              No need to repeat and repeat and...
              Style once
              Echoes of the past
            Styling a nav block element

              Text-shadow
              Note
            4 - Creating Accessible Experiences ----
            Testing browser support
              With an eye to the future
              What Modernizr really does
              Do it for the right reasons
            Adding skip navigation
              Full browser support
              Less equals more
            Adding meta tags
              Whatchu talkin' 'bout?
              It all comes back to SEO
              Did I do that?
            Using semantic descriptions in tags for screen readers
              Always improve
              Semantics for good SEO
              Greg finally learned
            Providing alternate site views
              Min-width
              My math teacher was right
              Is bigger always better?
            Using hgroup to create accessible header areas
            Displaying alternate content for non-supported browsers
            Using WAI-ARIA
              Still awaiting browser support
              That's how I role
              Accessibility first
            5 - Learning to Love Forms ----
