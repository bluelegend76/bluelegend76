            GNU Emacs Survival Card
            for version 26

            In the following, C-z means hit the ‘z’ key while holding
            down the Ctrl key. M-z means hit the ‘z’ key while hitting
            the Meta (labeled Alt on some keyboards) or after hitting
            Esc key.

            Running Emacs
            To enter GNU Emacs, just type its name: emacs. Emacs
            divides the frame into several areas: menu line, buffer area
            with the edited text, mode line describing the buffer in the
            window above it, and a minibuffer/echo area in the last line.
            C-x C-c
            C-x C-f

            C-x C-s
            C-x k
            C-g
            C-x u

            quit Emacs
            edit file; this command uses the minibuffer to
            read the file name; use this to create new files
            by entering the name of the new file
            save the file
            kill a buffer
            in most context: cancel, stop, abort partially
            typed or executing command
            undo

            Moving About
            C-l
            C-x b
            M-<
            M->
            M-g M-g

            scroll current line to center of window
            switch to another buffer
            move to beginning of buffer
            move to end of buffer
            go to a given line number

            remove the current window from the display

            split window horizontally
            split window vertically
            move to other window

            Emacs defines a ‘region’ as the space between the mark and
            the point. A mark is set with C-space. The point is at the
            cursor position.
            mark entire paragraph
            mark entire buffer

            Tags
            Tags tables files record locations of function and procedure
            definitions, global variables, data types and anything else
            convenient. To create a tags table file, type ‘etags input files’
            as a shell command.
            M-.
            find a definition
            C-u M-.
