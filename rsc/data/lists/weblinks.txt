DotNet Core: Build A WebAPI {{{

If I have gotten the task (at work) to build a web API and also using DotNet Core, could you help me list some of the major concepts that would be of help and crucial to understand, i.e. I'm looking for an overview and concepts here?

Absolutely! Building a web API with .NET Core (now just .NET) involves understanding several key concepts. Here's an overview of the crucial areas to focus on:

1. ASP.NET Core Web API Fundamentals:

    Controllers:
        These are the heart of your API. They handle incoming HTTP requests and return responses.
        Understand how to create API controllers using the ApiController attribute.
        Learn about routing and how to map HTTP requests to controller actions.
    Routing:
        Learn how to define routes to map URLs to controller actions.
        Understand attribute routing (e.g., [Route("api/[controller]")], [HttpGet], [HttpPost]).
        Learn about route parameters and constraints.
    HTTP Methods:
        Master the standard HTTP methods: GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, and PATCH.
        Understand their purpose and when to use each one.
    HTTP Status Codes:
        Learn the common HTTP status codes (e.g., 200 OK, 201 Created, 400 Bad Request, 404 Not Found, 500 Internal Server Error).
        Use appropriate status codes to indicate the outcome of API requests.
    Request/Response Handling:
        Understand how to access request data (e.g., query parameters, request body).
        Learn how to serialize and deserialize data (JSON, XML).
        Understand how to return appropriate responses, including data and status codes.
    Middleware:
        Learn how to use middleware to handle cross-cutting concerns (e.g., logging, authentication, authorization).
        Understand the middleware pipeline and how requests flow through it.
    Dependency Injection (DI):
        .NET Core has built-in DI support.
        Learn how to register and resolve dependencies to create loosely coupled and testable code.
    Configuration:
        Understand how to configure your API using configuration files (e.g., appsettings.json) and environment variables.
        Learn how to access configuration data in your code.

2. Data Handling and Persistence:

    Entity Framework Core (EF Core):
        A powerful ORM (Object-Relational Mapper) for interacting with databases.
        Learn how to define data models, perform CRUD operations, and use migrations.
    Data Transfer Objects (DTOs):
        Use DTOs to decouple your API's data models from your database models.
        This improves security and flexibility.
    Data Validation:
        Implement data validation to ensure that incoming data is valid.
        Use data annotations or FluentValidation.
    Asynchronous Programming:
        Since most web api's will access a database, it is very important to understand async/await.

    CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing):
        Configure CORS to control which origins can access your API.
        This is essential for security in web applications.

4. Testing:

    Unit Testing:
        Write unit tests to verify the behavior of individual components.
        Use testing frameworks like xUnit or NUnit.
    Integration Testing:
        Write integration tests to verify the interaction between different components.
        Test the API's endpoints and database interactions.
    API Testing Tools:
        Use tools like Postman or Swagger/OpenAPI to test your API's endpoints.

5. Documentation and API Design:

    Swagger/OpenAPI:
        Use Swagger/OpenAPI to generate interactive API documentation.
        This makes it easy for developers to understand and use your API.
    RESTful API Design Principles:
        Follow RESTful API design principles to create consistent and predictable APIs.
        Use appropriate HTTP methods, status codes, and resource naming conventions.
    Versioning:
        Implement API versioning to handle changes to your API over time.

6. Performance and Scalability:

    Caching:
        Implement caching to improve performance.
        Use in-memory caching or distributed caching.
    Logging:
        Implement logging to track API usage and errors.

Restful API Design-Principles {{{

Very very good. Could you help me a bit in explaining RESTful API Design Principles a bit more? What are some of the most important concepts and recommended practices, and perhaps also what some interesting anti-patterns to be watchful of?

Absolutely! RESTful API design principles are crucial for building APIs that are easy to understand, use, and maintain. Here's a deeper dive into the key concepts, recommended practices, and anti-patterns:

Key RESTful API Design Principles:

    Client-Server Architecture:
        The client and server are separate entities. The client initiates requests, and the server processes them and returns responses.
        This separation allows for independent evolution of the client and server.

    Statelessness:
        Each request from the client to the server must contain all the information needed to understand and process the request.   

        The server does not store any client session state between requests.
        This makes APIs more scalable and reliable.

    Cacheability:
        Responses should be cacheable whenever possible.
        Use HTTP caching headers (e.g., Cache-Control, ETag) to indicate whether a response can be cached and for how long.
        Caching improves performance and reduces server load.

    Uniform Interface:
        This is the cornerstone of REST. It consists of four sub-principles:
            Resource Identification in Requests: Resources are identified in requests using URIs (Uniform Resource Identifiers).
            Resource Manipulation Through Representations: Clients manipulate resources by sending representations of those resources (e.g., JSON, XML).
            Self-Descriptive Messages: Messages should be self-descriptive, containing enough information for the client to understand them. Use standard media types (e.g., application/json) and appropriate HTTP headers.
            Hypermedia as the Engine of Application State (HATEOAS): Responses should contain links to related resources, allowing clients to navigate the API dynamically. This makes the API more discoverable.

    Layered System:
        The architecture can consist of multiple layers (e.g., load balancers, proxies, gateways).
        Clients should not be able to tell whether they are communicating directly with the end server or with an intermediary.

    Code on Demand (Optional):
        Servers can optionally send executable code to clients (e.g., JavaScript).
        This is less common in modern REST APIs.

Recommended Practices:

    Use Nouns for Resources:
        Use nouns to represent resources (e.g., /customers, /products).
        Avoid verbs in resource names.
    Use HTTP Methods Correctly:
        GET: Retrieve a resource.
        POST: Create a new resource.
        PUT: Update an existing resource (replace the entire resource).
        PATCH: Update an existing resource (partial update).
        DELETE: Delete a resource.
    Use HTTP Status Codes Appropriately:
        200 OK: Successful request.
        201 Created: Resource created successfully.
        204 No Content: Successful request, no response body.
        400 Bad Request: Client error.
        401 Unauthorized: Authentication required.
        403 Forbidden: Authorization failed.
        404 Not Found: Resource not found.
        500 Internal Server Error: Server error.
    Use JSON for Data Exchange:
        JSON is the most common and widely supported format for data exchange in REST APIs.
    Implement Versioning:
        Use versioning to handle changes to your API over time (e.g., /v1/customers, /v2/customers).
    Provide Clear Documentation:
        Use Swagger/OpenAPI to generate interactive API documentation.
    Implement Pagination:
        For large collections of resources, implement pagination to limit the number of results returned in a single response.
    Implement Filtering and Sorting:
        Allow clients to filter and sort resources using query parameters.
    Handle Errors Gracefully:
        Return informative error messages with appropriate HTTP status codes.

Anti-Patterns:

    Using Verbs in Resource Names:
        Avoid resource names like /getCustomers or /updateProduct. Use nouns instead.
    Ignoring HTTP Methods:
        Using only GET and POST for all operations.
    Returning 200 OK for All Errors:
        Use appropriate HTTP status codes to indicate errors.
    Over- or Under-Fetching Data:
        Return only the data that the client needs.
        Graphql is a very good tool to combat this antipattern.
    Lack of Versioning:
        Making breaking changes without versioning.
    Ignoring HATEOAS:
        Failing to provide links to related resources.
    Chatty APIs:
        Requiring many round trips to the server to perform a single operation.
    Inconsistent Naming Conventions:
        Using different naming conventions for resources and parameters.
    Security Vulnerabilities:
        Failing to implement proper authentication and authorization.

By adhering to RESTful API design principles and avoiding anti-patterns, you can create APIs that are robust, scalable, and easy to use.

Could we (as an example) take a quick look at pattern-matching? I'm familiar with the concept from other languages (like e.g. F# and OCaml), but is it similar in C# or is it based on different precepts or style etc?

Yes, let's delve into pattern matching in C#. While the core concept of matching values against patterns is similar to F# and OCaml, C# has its own syntax and nuances.

C# Pattern Matching Basics:

C# pattern matching allows you to test an expression against a pattern and perform actions based on the result. It's particularly useful for:

    Type Checking: Verifying the type of an object.
    Value Matching: Comparing values against specific constants or ranges.
    Property Matching: Inspecting the properties of an object.
    Tuple Matching: Working with tuples.

Key Pattern Matching Features:

    is Operator:
        Used to check if an expression matches a pattern.
        Can perform type checks and variable declarations.
    C#

object obj = "Hello";
if (obj is string str)
{
    Console.WriteLine(str.Length); // str is a string variable now
}

switch Expressions:

    A more concise and expressive way to write switch statements.
    Supports pattern matching directly within case labels.

C#

int value = 10;
string result = value switch
{
    < 0 => "Negative",
    0 => "Zero",
    > 0 and < 20 => "Positive and less than 20",
    _ => "Positive and 20 or greater" // Discard pattern
};
Console.WriteLine(result);

Property Patterns:

    Allows you to match against the properties of an object.

C#

public class Point { public int X { get; set; } public int Y { get; set; } }
Point p = new Point { X = 10, Y = 20 };
if (p is { X: 10, Y: > 15 })
{
    Console.WriteLine("Point with X=10 and Y>15");
}

Tuple Patterns:

    Enables you to match against tuples.

C#

(int x, int y) = (5, 10);
string result = (x, y) switch
{
    (0, 0) => "Origin",
    (> 0, > 0) => "Quadrant I",
    _ => "Other"
};
Console.WriteLine(result);

Positional Patterns:

    Works with types that have a deconstructor.

C#

public class Coordinate { public int X { get; set; } public int Y { get; set; } public void Deconstruct(out int x, out int y) {x = X; y = Y;}}
Coordinate c = new Coordinate {X = 3, Y = 5};
if (c is (3, var y))
{
    Console.WriteLine($"Y value is {y}");
}

Type Patterns:

    Simply checking the type of an object.

C#

object myObject = 123;
if (myObject is int)
{
    Console.WriteLine("Object is an integer");
}

Var Patterns:

    Captures the value of the expression.

C#

    object myObject = "test";
    if (myObject is var myVar)
    {
        Console.WriteLine($"myVar is {myVar}");
    }

Differences from F# and OCaml:

    Syntax: C#'s pattern matching syntax is different from F# and OCaml. C# uses is and switch expressions, while F# and OCaml use match expressions.
    Focus: C# pattern matching is often used for type checking and property inspection, in addition to value matching. F# and OCaml pattern matching is more deeply integrated with algebraic data types and recursive data structures.
    Immutability: F# and OCaml emphasize immutability, which often goes hand in hand with pattern matching. C# is more flexible, allowing both mutable and immutable data.
    Algebraic Data Types: C# does not have direct support for algebraic data types like F# and OCaml. However, record types and discriminated unions (with some work) can achieve similar results.
    Exhaustiveness checking: F# and OCaml compilers will often warn you if a pattern match is not exhaustive, meaning that not all possible values are handled. C# does not have this feature to the same extent.

Similarities:

    Both C# and F#/OCaml pattern matching allow you to decompose data structures and perform actions based on the structure and values.
    Both are very useful for creating more expressive and concise code.
    Both paradigms increase the readability of code, when used correctly.

In summary:

C# pattern matching is a powerful feature that enhances conditional logic and data processing. While it shares similarities with F# and OCaml, it has its own unique syntax and focus. It's a valuable tool for writing more expressive and maintainable C# code.

dotnet MAUI/Avalonia/WinUI 3/ {{{

You're facing a common dilemma! Choosing the right UI framework for a desktop application can be overwhelming with so many options available.  Let's break down your situation and explore the best fits for your C# .NET Core backend and Windows desktop/taskbar requirements.

Here's a breakdown of the options you mentioned, focusing on their suitability for your needs:

Strong Contenders (Recommended):

    .NET MAUI (Multi-platform App UI):  This is likely your best option.  MAUI is Microsoft's evolution of Xamarin.Forms and is designed specifically for cross-platform development, including Windows desktop.  Crucially, it integrates very well with .NET and C#, making it a natural fit for your backend.  MAUI applications run natively on Windows, so they'll appear on the taskbar automatically without any extra effort.  It's actively developed and supported by Microsoft.

    Avalonia UI: A very strong cross-platform UI framework.  While not as tightly coupled to .NET as MAUI, it's still very .NET-friendly (written in C#) and offers excellent performance and flexibility.  It's a mature and stable framework.  Like MAUI, it creates native applications, so taskbar integration is automatic.  If you're looking for a more "classic" desktop UI feel and have concerns about MAUI's maturity, Avalonia is a great choice.

Potentially Suitable (but with caveats):

    Blazor Hybrid:  Blazor allows you to build UIs with HTML, CSS, and C# (using Razor components).  Blazor Hybrid lets you embed these web-based UIs into native desktop applications.  This is a good option if you have a team with web development skills.  However, while they will appear on the taskbar, they are technically hosted in a webview, which can sometimes have a slightly less "native" feel compared to MAUI or Avalonia.

    WinUI 3 (Windows App SDK):  This is Microsoft's native UI framework for Windows 10 and 11.  It's very powerful and provides access to the latest Windows features.  However, it's not cross-platform.  Since you mentioned "preferably" working on other platforms, WinUI 3 is less ideal unless you're absolutely certain you'll only ever target Windows.  Taskbar integration is, of course, built-in.

Less Suitable for Your Needs:

    React/TypeScript (with Electron or similar): While React and TypeScript are excellent for web development, using them for a desktop application usually involves Electron or similar frameworks.  These create applications that are essentially web pages wrapped in a browser.  This approach tends to consume more resources and can have a less native feel.  It's not the best choice for a primarily .NET/C# backend and doesn't offer any significant advantages over MAUI or Avalonia in your case.

    WebUI 3: This framework is designed for building web-based user interfaces. While you could embed a WebUI 3 application in a desktop app, it's generally not the recommended approach for this kind of scenario.  It's more geared towards building web applications.

Recommendation:

For your situation, .NET MAUI is the most logical and straightforward choice.  It's tightly integrated with your .NET Core backend, is actively developed by Microsoft, supports Windows desktop natively (with automatic taskbar integration), and has cross-platform capabilities if you need them in the future.

If you have reservations about MAUI's maturity or prefer a more established desktop UI framework, Avalonia UI is a strong second choice.

Key Considerations:

    Team Skills: If your team has strong web development experience, Blazor Hybrid might be worth considering. However, for a primarily .NET/C# backend, the tighter integration of MAUI or Avalonia is usually preferred.
    Performance: MAUI and Avalonia generally offer better performance than web-based UI solutions like Electron or Blazor Hybrid (in a webview).
    Future Platform Needs: If cross-platform support is a definite requirement, MAUI is the clear winner.

I'd recommend starting with .NET MAUI.  It aligns perfectly with your existing technology stack and provides the native Windows desktop experience you're looking for.  If you encounter any issues or have specific requirements that MAUI doesn't address, then consider Avalonia UI as your next option.


Two questions: The team has indicated that the app will be Windows native and probably Windows only, and (with that said) Avalonia seems very interesting to me. The only caveat I've encountered is that I had a bit of trouble setting it up and getting compilation to work with Rider - which is my IDE of choice. That said (and you're free to comment on that if you want) I wonder if Avalonia integrates well when it comes to the taskbar?

You're right to consider Avalonia UI, especially given the Windows-native focus. It's an excellent framework. Let's address your questions:

    Avalonia and Taskbar Integration: Yes, Avalonia applications integrate seamlessly with the Windows taskbar. Because Avalonia creates native Windows applications, they behave just like any other Windows program.  You don't need any special code or configuration to get taskbar integration.  The application will appear in the taskbar automatically when it's running.  This includes standard taskbar features like:
        Application Icon: Your application's icon will be displayed on the taskbar.
        Right-Click Context Menu: Users can right-click the taskbar icon for standard options (e.g., close window, pin to taskbar).
        Taskbar Progress: If your application performs long-running tasks, you can even update the taskbar icon to show a progress bar.

    Avalonia Setup with Rider: You mentioned having some trouble setting up Avalonia with Rider. While Avalonia itself is well-documented, IDE integration can sometimes be tricky. Here are some tips that might help:

        Avalonia Rider Plugin: Make sure you have the Avalonia plugin installed in Rider. This plugin provides project templates, code completion, XAML previewing, and other helpful features.  You can find it in Rider's plugin manager (File | Settings | Plugins).

        .NET SDK: Ensure you have the correct .NET SDK installed. Avalonia typically works best with the latest LTS (Long Term Support) version of .NET.  You can check your installed SDKs using the command dotnet --list-sdks.

        Project Templates: When creating a new Avalonia project in Rider, use the Avalonia project templates provided by the plugin.  These templates should set up the project correctly with all the necessary dependencies and configurations.

        XAML Previewer: One of the key benefits of the Rider plugin is the XAML previewer.  If you're having trouble with compilation, the previewer might give you clues about XAML syntax errors or other issues.

        Clean and Rebuild: Sometimes, Rider's caches can get out of sync.  Try cleaning and rebuilding the project (Build | Clean Solution, then Build | Rebuild Solution).

        Check Avalonia Version:  Ensure that the Avalonia NuGet packages in your project are compatible with the Avalonia Rider plugin you have installed.  Sometimes, mismatches can cause problems.

        Rider Settings: Double-check Rider's settings related to .NET and NuGet.  Make sure it's pointing to the correct .NET SDK and NuGet feeds.

        Community Resources: If you're still stuck, the Avalonia community is very helpful.  Check their website, forums, or Discord server for solutions to common Rider integration issues.

        Consider the Avalonia UI template from the JetBrains Marketplace: JetBrains provides a template for Avalonia UI applications. You can access it through the JetBrains Marketplace. This template might provide a more stable setup experience compared to manually configuring the project.

If you're still facing specific errors, providing the error messages would be very helpful in troubleshooting.  I can then provide more tailored guidance.


I guess WinUi 3 could be a strong contender if Windows is the only target platform, and also, does Rider have good support for hot-reload when it comes to Avalonia and MAUI?

You're absolutely correct. If your application is definitely and exclusively targeting Windows, WinUI 3 becomes a very strong contender. It's Microsoft's modern, native UI framework for Windows, offering excellent performance and access to the latest Windows features.  It's the natural choice for a Windows-only application when you want the best possible integration with the operating system.

Now, regarding hot reload in Rider for Avalonia and MAUI:

    Avalonia: Rider's support for hot reload with Avalonia is generally quite good, especially with the Avalonia Rider plugin installed.  The XAML previewer is a big help, and you should be able to see many UI changes reflected almost instantly as you edit your XAML. However, hot reload isn't always perfect.  Complex changes or changes that affect the code-behind might require a full rebuild. But in many common UI development scenarios, it can save you a lot of time.

    MAUI: Hot reload with MAUI in Rider is a bit more of a mixed bag, and it's an area that's still under development. While MAUI has built-in hot reload capabilities, it can be a bit more finicky than with Avalonia. Rider's support is improving, but it might not be as reliable as with Avalonia or some other frameworks. You might encounter situations where hot reload doesn't work as expected, and you need to do a full rebuild.

Key factors that can affect hot reload performance:

    Complexity of UI changes: Simple changes to styles, layout, or text are more likely to hot reload successfully. More complex changes, like adding or removing controls, might require a rebuild.
    Code-behind changes: Changes to your C# code-behind logic are less likely to be hot reloaded and
    Project configuration: Correct project setup and dependencies are crucial for hot reload to work reliably.
    Rider and plugin versions: Keeping Rider and the Avalonia/MAUI plugins up to date is essential, as newer versions often include improvements to hot reload.

Tips for maximizing hot reload success:

    Start simple: When making UI changes, start with small, isolated changes to see how hot reload behaves.
    Check the output: Pay attention to Rider's output window for any messages related to hot reload. These messages might give you clues about why hot reload failed.
    Restart when needed: If hot reload becomes unreliable, don't hesitate to do a full rebuild or restart Rider.
    Keep everything updated: Ensure your .NET SDK, Rider, and Avalonia/MAUI packages and plugins are all up to date.

Ultimately, hot reload is a fantastic tool that can significantly speed up UI development, but it's not always perfect.  Be prepared to do full rebuilds when necessary, and don't rely on hot reload for absolutely critical changes without thorough testing.

If you're primarily targeting Windows and are leaning towards WinUI 3 or Avalonia, both are excellent choices. WinUI 3 gives you that deep Windows integration, while Avalonia offers great performance, a mature ecosystem, and generally good hot reload support in Rider.


I guess I could also use a hybrid approach of using both Visual Studio and Rider, like in the case of WinUI 3, to be able to both leverage Rider for its excellent C# and XAML support, and get hot-reload features using Visual Studio.

That's a perfectly valid and often effective strategy! Using a combination of Rider and Visual Studio can give you the best of both worlds, especially when working with frameworks like WinUI 3 where tooling support can vary.

Here's why a hybrid approach can be beneficial:

    Rider for C# and General Development: Rider excels at C# development, offering excellent code completion, refactoring tools, navigation, and debugging.  Its performance is often praised, especially for larger projects.  If your team is comfortable with Rider, it can be a very productive environment for the core logic and backend development.  Rider's XAML support, while good, might not always be as feature-rich as Visual Studio's for certain UI frameworks.

    Visual Studio for UI-Specific Tasks: Visual Studio, particularly for UI frameworks like WinUI 3, often has more mature and specialized tooling. This includes:
        Designer/Previewer: Visual Studio's XAML designer/previewer for WinUI 3 is generally considered very robust and provides a near real-time view of your UI as you design it.
        Hot Reload: Visual Studio's hot reload capabilities for WinUI 3 are usually well-integrated and reliable.
        UI Debugging: Visual Studio's debugging tools for UI can be more specialized for inspecting visual trees, data binding, and other UI-specific aspects.

    Workflow:  A common workflow would be:
        Core Logic in Rider: Develop the core application logic, backend services, and other C# code in Rider.
        UI Design in Visual Studio: Switch to Visual Studio when you're working on the UI design, especially when using features like the designer, previewer, or hot reload.
        Collaboration: If your team has a mix of developers who prefer different IDEs, this approach allows everyone to use their preferred tool for their area of expertise.

Considerations:

    Switching Between IDEs: Switching back and forth between IDEs can have a small overhead. However, with a well-structured project, this should be minimal.
    Project Files: Ensure that your project files are compatible between Rider and Visual Studio. The standard .NET project format usually works well, but it's always good to double-check.
    Source Control: Using a good source control system (like Git) is essential when working with multiple IDEs. This helps to manage changes and avoid conflicts.

In your specific case:

Given your focus on WinUI 3 and the desire for robust hot reload, using Visual Studio for the UI development and Rider for the backend/C# development is a very reasonable and practical approach.  It lets you leverage the strengths of each IDE for its respective domain.  Many professional development teams use this type of hybrid approach.


As long as I can get Avalonia up and running in Rider (maybe by focusing on just the 'Windows native' compilation and target first), then I think that could be one of my favorite options. It seems like a really great choice.

You're on the right track! Focusing on the Windows-native compilation and target first with Avalonia in Rider is an excellent strategy. It allows you to get the core setup working smoothly and then gradually expand to other platforms if needed.

Here's a refined approach for getting Avalonia up and running in Rider specifically for Windows:

    Install the Avalonia Rider Plugin: This is crucial. Go to File | Settings | Plugins (or Rider | Preferences | Plugins on macOS) and search for "Avalonia". Install the plugin and restart Rider.

    Create a New Avalonia UI Application (Windows-Specific):
        In Rider, create a new project. Look for the Avalonia UI Application template. (The plugin should provide it.)
        When prompted, choose the "Desktop" or "Windows" platform target. This will configure the project specifically for Windows. Don't select cross-platform targets initially.

    Verify .NET SDK: Ensure you have the .NET SDK installed that Avalonia supports. Check the Avalonia documentation for the recommended version.  You can check your installed SDKs with dotnet --list-sdks in the command line.

    Build and Run: Try building and running the default Avalonia application. This will confirm that the basic setup is working.

    Troubleshooting: If you encounter any issues:
        Clean and Rebuild: Try Build | Clean Solution, then Build | Rebuild Solution.
        Check NuGet Packages: Make sure the Avalonia NuGet packages are installed and compatible. Look at the *.csproj file.
        Check Rider Logs: Rider usually has logs that can provide more information about errors.
        Community Support: The Avalonia community is very active. Their website, forums, and Discord are excellent resources.

    XAML Previewer: Once the project builds, try opening a XAML file. The Avalonia Rider plugin should provide a previewer. This is a great way to see your UI changes in real-time.

    Hot Reload (Experiment): Start making small changes to your XAML and see if hot reload works. Remember that it's not always perfect, so be prepared to rebuild if necessary.

By focusing on the Windows target first, you simplify the initial setup and reduce the number of potential issues. Once you have a working Windows version, you can then explore adding support for other platforms if your requirements change.

This approach should make getting Avalonia running in Rider much smoother.  Let me know if you encounter any specific errors, and I'll do my best to help!

PipeWire Audio Interface - Recording ARCH-Linux[!!] {{{

Could you give me a recommendation for some good sound control software that I can use instead of Pavucontrol on Arch Linux (and using Pipewire). For info: My needs are both for everyday use, but also when recording audio with software like Ardour etc.

Given your needs for both everyday use and professional audio recording with Ardour on Arch Linux with Pipewire, here's a strong recommendation:

QjackCtl

    Why it excels:
        Powerful and flexible: QjackCtl is a highly regarded JACK Control application. While JACK is often associated with professional audio production, QjackCtl can effectively manage your PipeWire setup for both everyday and demanding audio tasks.
        Comprehensive control: It provides granular control over audio routing, device selection, and latency settings, essential for low-latency recording and mixing.
        Visualization: QjackCtl offers visual representations of your audio connections, making it easier to understand and troubleshoot complex setups.
        Community and support: A well-established tool with a strong community and ample online resources available.

How to get started:

    Install QjackCtl:
    Bash

    sudo pacman -S qjackctl

    Start the JACK server: Launch QjackCtl and click "Start." This initiates the JACK server, which will manage audio connections within your system.
    Configure for PipeWire:
        QjackCtl might require some initial configuration to work seamlessly with PipeWire. Refer to the QjackCtl documentation and online resources for specific guidance on integrating it with your PipeWire setup.

Note:

    While QjackCtl is a powerful tool, it might have a steeper learning curve compared to simpler volume control applications. However, the investment in learning QjackCtl will pay off significantly, especially for professional audio work.

Alternatives (for simpler everyday use):

    PipeWire Pulse: This provides a PulseAudio-like interface on top of PipeWire, offering a familiar experience for those accustomed to PulseAudio.
    coppwr: A command-line tool and a graphical user interface for controlling PipeWire. It provides a more direct way to interact with PipeWire's components.

I recommend experimenting with these options to find the best fit for your workflow. QjackCtl is likely to provide the most flexibility and control for your professional audio needs, while PipeWire Pulse or coppwr might be more suitable for everyday use.

Are there some other ones you could mention? I seem to remember some other options that were not in that list that you mentioned some other time we had a conversation.

Unfortunately, I don't have access to the specific details of our past conversations. However, I can provide you with some additional sound control software options for Arch Linux with PipeWire:

    Mixerman: A simple and lightweight GUI for controlling audio devices and mixers. It's particularly useful for quick adjustments to volume levels and input/output selections.
    Gnoll Audio Mixer: A GNOME-based audio mixer that provides a more traditional mixer interface with sliders and knobs for adjusting volume levels.
    Pavucontrol (with PipeWire Pulse): As mentioned earlier, while primarily designed for PulseAudio, Pavucontrol can still be used with PipeWire Pulse, offering a familiar interface for managing audio devices and streams.

These options offer varying levels of complexity and features. Mixerman is the simplest, while Gnoll Audio Mixer and Pavucontrol provide more comprehensive controls. You can choose the one that best suits your needs and preferences.

Remember that the best choice for you will depend on your specific requirements and how comfortable you are with different user interfaces. I recommend trying out a few of these options to see which one you find most intuitive and helpful for your workflow.

I hope this helps!

I've got some problem when listening to music in for example vlc, and then entering a Discord audio chat (on an Arch system). For some reason, as soon as I enter the audio chat, the sound from vlc running in the background gets attenuated and a bit garbled, and it returns to normal as soon as I exit the Discord audio chat. I'm trying to find some relevant setting in Discord's audio settings, but I can't find something that looks particularly relevant. Also, I never had this issue in Ubuntu - i.e. the background music running in vlc never got garbled or such.

The issue you're describing with background audio being attenuated and garbled when joining a Discord voice chat on Arch Linux, while not occurring in Ubuntu, likely stems from differences in how audio is handled by the respective operating systems and their associated sound servers.

Possible Causes:

    PipeWire Configuration:
        Application Profiles: PipeWire might be applying application profiles that unintentionally affect the audio output of VLC when a Discord voice chat is active. These profiles can adjust volume levels, routing, and other audio parameters for specific applications.
        Quality of Service (QoS): PipeWire may be prioritizing Discord's audio traffic over other applications, leading to reduced bandwidth and quality for VLC.
        Conflicting Modules: Some PipeWire modules or configurations might interfere with the proper functioning of VLC or Discord.

    Discord's Audio Settings:
        Input/Output Devices: Ensure that the correct input and output devices are selected in Discord's audio settings. Incorrect settings can cause unexpected audio behavior.
        Noise Suppression/Echo Cancellation: These features can sometimes interfere with background audio, especially if they are overly aggressive. Try adjusting or disabling them temporarily to see if it improves the situation.

    Hardware Issues:
        Sound Card/Driver Conflicts: In rare cases, issues with your sound card or its drivers could contribute to the problem.

Troubleshooting Steps:

    Check PipeWire Configuration:
        Examine Application Profiles: Use tools like pw-cli or pipewire-pulse to inspect and modify application profiles if applicable.
        Review QoS Settings: If PipeWire supports QoS, adjust settings to ensure fair resource allocation between applications.
        Check for Conflicting Modules: Disable or adjust any potentially conflicting PipeWire modules.

    Adjust Discord Audio Settings:
        Verify Input/Output Devices: Double-check that the correct input and output devices are selected for both voice and desktop audio.
        Test Noise Suppression/Echo Cancellation: Temporarily disable or adjust these features to see if it resolves the issue.

    Update Drivers and Software:
        Ensure your sound card drivers and all relevant software (PipeWire, PulseAudio, Discord, VLC) are updated to the latest versions.

    Restart Services:
        Restart the PipeWire server and related services (e.g., PulseAudio if applicable).

    Test with Other Applications:
        Try playing audio from other applications (e.g., Spotify, YouTube) while in a Discord voice chat to see if the issue is specific to VLC.

If the problem persists, consider seeking assistance from the Arch Linux forums or the PipeWire community. They may have encountered similar issues or have more specific troubleshooting advice for your particular setup.

I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any further questions or need more specific guidance.

Arch: Locale etc {{{

Could you help me with two Arch-issues:


1. When installing, we set the keyboard to Swedish Dvorak, and it works perfectly when logged in, but, at the login screen (weirdly) the keyboard is set to American style (I think - normal Qwerty + to get an underscore, I have to press Shift + plus).

I suspect we may have set locales badly when installing, but what's your take + possible (command-line based) solutions.

2. I have my language set to Swedish when logged in, but I would like to change that to American English. Could you suggest how I could do that from the command-line?

1. Keyboard Layout at Login Screen

    Identify the Login Manager:
        Determine which display manager you're using (e.g., GDM, LightDM, SDDM). You can usually find this information in your desktop environment's settings.

    Configure the Login Manager:

        GDM:
            Edit the GDM configuration file: sudo nano /etc/gdm/custom.conf
            Add the following lines to the file:

            [daemon]
            # Uncomment and set the desired keyboard layout
            #keyboard-layout = "us" 
            keyboard-layout = "se" 

                Replace "us" with "se" (or the appropriate code for your Swedish Dvorak layout) and save the file.
                Restart GDM: sudo systemctl restart gdm

        LightDM:
            Edit the LightDM configuration file: sudo nano /etc/lightdm/lightdm.conf.d/50-user.conf
            Add the following lines:

            [SeatDefaults]
            xkb_layout = "se" 

                Replace "us" with "se" (or the appropriate code for your Swedish Dvorak layout) and save the file.
                Restart LightDM: sudo systemctl restart lightdm

        SDDM:
            Edit the SDDM configuration file: sudo nano /etc/sddm.conf
            Find the [General] section and add or modify the following line:

            [General]
            keyboard-layout=se 

                Replace "us" with "se" (or the appropriate code for your Swedish Dvorak layout) and save the file.
                Restart SDDM: sudo systemctl restart sddm

    Test the Changes:
        Reboot your system to see if the keyboard layout is correctly set at the login screen.

2. Changing System Language to American English

    Edit Locale Configuration:
    Bash

sudo nano /etc/locale.gen

    Uncomment the line for en_US.UTF-8 by removing the # symbol.
    Comment out any other locale lines that you don't need.
    Save and close the file.

Generate Locales:
Bash

sudo locale-gen

Set System Locale:

    Edit the locale configuration file:
    Bash

    sudo nano /etc/locale.conf

    Set the LANG variable to en_US.UTF-8:

    LANG=en_US.UTF-8

    Save and close the file.

Restart Services:

    Restart relevant services:
    Bash

        sudo systemctl restart systemd-logind 
        sudo systemctl restart display-manager 

        (Replace display-manager with the name of your display manager: GDM, LightDM, SDDM)

    Logout and Log Back In:
        Log out of your current session and log back in for the changes to take effect.

Important Notes:

    Locale Codes: Ensure that you use the correct locale codes for your desired keyboard layout and language. You can find a list of available locales in the /usr/share/i18n/locales directory.
    Restart: After making any configuration changes, it's crucial to restart the relevant services and log out/in to apply the changes.
    Troubleshooting: If you encounter issues, check the system logs (journalctl -xe) for any error messages related to the keyboard layout or locale settings.

I hope these steps help you resolve your keyboard layout and language issues!

minimal browsers {{{

What are some good small footprint web browsers for Arch-linux, preferably ones that also have a dark-mode?

1. Firefox

    Pros:
        Highly customizable with a vast extension ecosystem.
        Strong privacy features.
        Excellent performance and resource usage.
        Built-in dark mode.
    Cons:
        Can be resource-intensive compared to some of the truly lightweight options.

2. Vivaldi

    Pros:
        Highly customizable with a focus on power user features.
        Excellent tab management and note-taking features.
        Built-in ad blocker and tracker blocker.
        Dark mode available.
    Cons:
        Can be more resource-intensive than some of the more minimalist browsers.

3. Brave

    Pros:
        Strong emphasis on privacy with built-in ad and tracker blocking.
        Based on Chromium, so it generally provides good compatibility with web standards.
        Has a dark mode.
    Cons:
        Can be resource-intensive, especially with its default settings.

4. Falkon

    Pros:
        Lightweight and fast, designed for KDE but works well on other desktops.
        Built-in ad blocker.
        Supports dark mode.
    Cons:
        May not have as many features or extensions as some of the more popular browsers.

5. Qutebrowser

    Pros:
        Highly keyboard-driven, making it very efficient for power users.
        Extremely lightweight and fast.
        Customizable with Python scripting.
        Supports dark mode.
    Cons:
        Steeper learning curve due to its keyboard-centric nature.

Important Notes:

    Resource Usage: The term "small footprint" is subjective. These browsers generally have a lower resource impact than Chrome or Edge, but your mileage may vary depending on your hardware and usage patterns.
    Dark Mode: All of these browsers offer a dark mode option, either built-in or through extensions.
    Testing: The best way to determine the best browser for you is to try them out yourself. Install a few and see which one best suits your needs and preferences.

Remember to install these browsers through the Arch User Repository (AUR) using tools like yay or aurutils.

I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any other questions.
